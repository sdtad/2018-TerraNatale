	<p>The skin on the paws of dogs is very strong, but still, it also needs care. Elastic paw pads protect the joints and bones of the dog’s body by absorbing the paws on the ground. Dog pads are subject to constant wear throughout its life, and they may wear out prematurely due to the harmful effects of unnatural animal cover.</p>

<p> The skin on the paw pads of a dog can become rough and dry and may even crack. </p>
<p> Overdried dog paws instinctively lick as they experience feelings of pain, itching or burning. </p>
<p> This should be a signal to its owner that all is not well with the dog. </p>
<p> Sufficient attention should be paid to caring for your dog's paws so that they can be healthy and serve it for the rest of their lives. </p>
<p style = "color: #993300; text-transform: uppercase;"> To care for dog paws you need: </p>
<p> • Baby soap; </p>
<p> • Antibacterial cream or spray; </p>
<p> • Protective and moisturizing creams; </p>
<p> • Claw cutter. </p>
<p style = "color: #993300; text-transform: uppercase;"> Instructions: </p>
<p> 1. Inspect the paws and folds of the dog's paws for cuts, cracks, and possible splinters. </p>
<p> Gently wash the paw pads with soap and water, dry thoroughly and lubricate with any antibacterial healing ointment. </p>
<p> 2. Regularly lubricate the paw pads of the dog with any moisturizer so that they do not get rough or cracked. Use for walks special protective wax for dogs. The increased dryness of the paw pads in dogs can be caused by long or frequent walks on the asphalt, and also be a result of various allergies. </p>
<p> If a dog often licks his fingers and paw pads, and also combs his ears, then the most common cause of this is an allergy. In such cases, you should contact your veterinarian for advice and treatment. </p>
<p> 3. Try to choose such walking routes, so that the dog walked less on the sidewalk. </p>
<p> If the dog already has cracks on the paws, then do not walk with it on the splitting of mowed grass, dirt, very fine gravel or sand, which can penetrate coarsely into the skin cracks, cause pain and infect wounds. </p>
<p> If the weather is especially hot, then avoid asphalt, which can be so hot that it will literally burn the dog's paws. Also with hot sand, which, in addition, due to its roughness and instability, can exacerbate problems or cause the formation of new cracks on the pads. </p>
<p> If you take your dog for a walk in the summer along the beach, then walk with it along the edge of the water, where the sand is smoother and cooled by water. </p>
<p> 4. Inspect and trim your dog's claws regularly. When a dog has too long claws, they start knocking loudly on the floor. Strongly running claws can even reach such a length that they will dig into the body (especially it is necessary to keep track of the dewclaws) and make normal walking for the dog impossible. </p>
<p> In addition, on walks, excessively long claws often break quite painfully, and then bleed for a long time, since there are also blood vessels inside them. In order for the dog not to be afraid and not to be shocked by the claw trimming procedure, it must be taught from the puppyhood age. </p>
<p> 5. Try to wash the dog's paws every time after walking in the winter, if you walked along the road covered with reagents or sprinkled with salt. If your dog is prone to allergies, then do not use detergents for floors, which through licking paws can enter the dog's body. </p>
<p> In winter, it is quite possible to use dog boots to protect the dog's paws from reagents and salt. </p>
<p> To teach the dog to wear "shoes" should be gradually, doing it first at home. </p>
