<h3> Methods for diagnosing pregnancy in Labrador </h3>
<p> 1. The presence of pregnancy can be determined using the characteristic signs listed in the calendar of the pregnant bitch. </p>
<p> 2. Ultrasound examination is performed on the 21-24 day of pregnancy. On the screen of the ultrasound device, amniotic bubbles with embryos inside are clearly visualized. In order to predict the course of pregnancy and assess the vitality of the fetus, an ultrasound examination is best carried out at later stages of pregnancy. </p>

<p> 3. It is possible to diagnose early pregnancy with the help of laboratory tests - a comprehensive serum test for the hormone relaxin. </p>
<p> 4. Doctors of veterinary care recommend in the later stages of pregnancy (7 weeks), especially with large litters, x-ray examination. During this period of pregnancy, the number of puppies is determined more accurately. </p>
<p> Diet and exercise of a pregnant bitch In the first half of pregnancy, the dog has no specific dietary requirements, but it must be fully balanced with the addition of vitamin-mineral supplements. </p>
<p> During pregnancy, the metabolism changes, the need for energy increases, so a proper, balanced diet is necessary for the well-being of the mother and fetuses. A newborn puppy, up to "weaning", is fed by the mother's nutrients and if the emerging fetus lacks the nutrients, then it "selects" them from the mother. If the diet of your "girl" is made up of dry food - go on food for pregnant and lactating dogs, add folic acid, this will be enough to provide your dog with all the nutrients. </p>
<p> If a dog eats natural products, then it is necessary to add vitamin and mineral complexes to the diet, because the need for vitamins during this period increases 2-2, 5 times. </p>
<p> Vitamin-mineral complexes for pregnant and lactating bitches are best suited. </p>

<p> In the second half of pregnancy, it is especially necessary to carefully monitor the necessary intake of the main building substances (proteins, minerals) into the body of a puppy dog. during this period of pregnancy, there is an increased growth of the fruits and their need for nutrients involved in the formation of the puppy's body increases. Nutrients entering the body of a dog must replenish not only the costs of the body of a pregnant dog, but also the requirements of the emerging fruits. </p>
<p> In the second half of pregnancy, the uterus of the puppy dog is significantly increased in size, which does not allow the bitch to absorb the previous amount of feed for one feeding and fill the entire stomach. During this period, it is necessary not only to increase the caloric and nutritional value of a pregnant dog, but also to increase its fragmentation, i.e. It is necessary to feed the dog 3 times a day, and 2 weeks before giving birth - 4 times, but in smaller portions. Try not to worry your “girl” in vain, you shouldn’t take her in a car for a long time, and visit your dog. </p>
<p> In no case do not let your pet jump from a height. Raise the "Mommy" should be carefully and slowly, supporting the torso from the bottom and hugging him. However, short walks and normal dog hygiene should be observed, but be short and gentle (as a pet). </p>
<p> During pregnancy in the warm season, well when the bitch walks in the sun, the dog's body under the action of ultraviolet produces vitamin D, which is necessary in the metabolism of minerals, with vitamin D is absorbed much more from calcium. It is very important that when the fruit is tied up (up to 20 days after mating), the bitch does not have a deficiency of folic acid and vitamin E. </p>
<p> Folic acid is abundant in the green parts of plants. Perhaps the richest source are fresh raspberry leaves, if not, it can be replaced with dried ones. Raspberry leaves can be purchased at the pharmacy or prepare yourself in the spring and summer. It is best to collect the leaves in late May - early June. </p>
<p> There is also a lot of folic acid in green asparagus, broccoli, all kinds of greens. </p>
<p> Vitamin E. </p>
<p> The richest source of vitamin E is sprouted wheat grains. It is also a lot in raw yolk. </p>
<p> It is better to take the quail egg yolk, it exceeds the chicken content several times in the content of vitamins. </p>
<p> There is vitamin E and in vegetable oil. It is necessary to grind everything finely on a blender, the dogs' stomach is not adapted to the splitting of fiber. The mixture should be immediately ready for easy digestibility. </p>
<p> When grinding, you need to add a little water to make the consistency of liquid porridge. </p>
<p> Then you can add it to the curd or add to the sliced meat. </p>

<h3> Hygiene of a pregnant Labrador dog </h3>
<p> Hygienic care for a pregnant dog includes daily inspection of the pet, wool cleaning, skin monitoring. In the second half of pregnancy, a puppy dog may experience mucous secretions from the birth canal, which it usually licks, but if it does not do it on its own, it is recommended to wash the secretions with clean water. However, two weeks before the birth the dog should not be washed any more. </p>
<p> If your dog has not been de-wormed before breeding, now this process will have to be postponed for two weeks after giving birth. Even during the preparation of the dog for mating, avoid the use of drugs, and a pregnant dog is prescribed only by a doctor at the very least. Do not allow the dog to communicate with stray animals. </p>
<p> Take it with understanding to the possibility of a pet to do "their own affairs" by chance at home, because in the last term of pregnancy it will be quite difficult for her to tolerate and wait for a walk. </p>
<p> Do not scold and do not punish her for the late bladder emptying. By the time your dog should be puffed up, it is necessary to prepare in advance a comfortable, quiet and warm place, without drafts, with convenient access. </p>
<p> Your pet should get used and nestle in it. A dog begins to prepare for whelping within 24 hours, the temperature drops by 1-2 degrees, she withdraws, looks for a place for herself, digs it, and often even refuses her favorite food. It is advisable that a veterinarian be present during the birth and, if necessary, could take emergency measures. </p>
