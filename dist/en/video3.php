	<p>National Geographic. In The Womb: Dogs</p>
	<p>Welcome to the fascinating journey from a single cage to a man’s best friend in just 63 days. <br> The audience will be presented with unique shots of how life for dogs before birth, including such unexpected aspects as false pregnancy, fetal reabsorption, breathing and puppy running inside the womb. But even more surprising will be the story of how over the millennia of development and life next to a man the wolf evolved into a dog. After 63 days, the dog's embryo will have everything it needs for survival, including a very keen sense of smell and ability hear sounds that are not perceived by a person’s ear. When the embryo is 40 days old, with the help of the 4-dimensional research technique (4D) we can see a unique image of how an unborn puppy opens its mouth and breathes. Trace the path of embryonic development - from fertilization to birth - three domestic dogs and their ancestor, the wolf.</p>
