<p> Dear friends! </p>
<p> I would like to devote this topic to raising puppies. </p>
<p> Why? </p>
<p> Because, not a single supplement, not a single vitamin, how excellent it could be, cannot be replaced, or it is better to say, to cancel the importance of proper cultivation and nutrition of a puppy. </p>
<p> Any additive - is what is inherent in this word - ADDITIVE. Additive to proper cultivation and nutrition. </p>
<p> In fact, if all dogs were properly grown and fed initially, from the moment they appear in the mother’s womb, the demand for supplements would be much lower, because dogs would have far fewer allergies. there are far fewer problems with the gastrointestinal tract, the musculoskeletal system and so we can continue this list ad infinitum. </p>
<p> Therefore, the topic of growing is incredibly important. </p>
<p> My personal experience is based on dogs of medium and large breeds. All that I will write is in no way the ultimate truth, but only my experience, which for me brings excellent results. </p>
<p> Maybe he will help you. </p>
<p> The dog's skeleton develops up to 12 months. The bone growth plates are closed at 10 months, but the bone continues to be modeled for up to 12 months - the cartilaginous cells of the plate are divided and “lined up” in columns in order to withstand the load of heavy bones in the future. While bones grow unsafely to give the big physical. load puppy. It is important that the puppy gets used to the street noise and different smells, but it is also important not to cause irreparable damage to the growing skeleton of the puppy. If you damage a puppy's skeleton, the result will be big problems in the future. Most of these problems are very painful, not curable, and end in lameness or paralysis. </p>
<h2> WHAT DOES A GROWING PUPPY NEED? </h2>
<p> A growing puppy needs plenty of sleep, proper nutrition, plenty of love and quiet exercises. A small game in the garden and a little walk outside and back is more than enough for a puppy. Do not forget to immediately stop any active games with the puppy as soon as he showed the first signs of fatigue. Young bones and joints will be damaged by too much stress, the results of which you can see only later, when you cannot fix anything. </p>
<p style = "color: #993300; text-transform: uppercase;"> Development of a puppy's joints </p>
<p> In order to understand what we are talking about, we need to take a quick look at the specifics of the development of the skeleton in puppies of medium and large breeds. </p>
<p> Puppy bones develop up to 12 months and do not harden until then. </p>
<p> Until bone formation is completed, TB and LS (hip and elbow joint) do not finally fall into place. </p>
<p> As long as the joint is not completely in place, any excessive load will lead to incorrect joint formation + dysplasia. </p>
<p> Lack of dysplasia from parents - DOES NOT WARRANT that your puppy will not have dysplasia. More than 70% of cases of dysplasia are the result of improperly growing a puppy. Dysplasia is not treated and, at best, you will have a dog with early arthritis, which is very painful for the dog. </p>
<p> With proper breeding, the bones will become strong and will be able to carry the weight of the dog, withstanding any load, but they cannot do this until the puppy is fully grown and not formed! </p>
<p> During growth, the bones are very soft, fragile and very prone to physical injury. Too much movement and physical exertion will lead to the fact that the bones are deformed and will cause great trouble to the dog throughout its life. </p>
<p> Injuries that the joint and bone receive during “simple walking” damage the cartilage results in a lack of blood circulation in the joint, giving the whole range of joint diseases. From dysplasia, arthritis to osteochondrosis, etc. </p>
<p style = "color: #993300; text-transform: uppercase;"> WALKING </p>
<p> In order to understand how long your puppy can walk, multiply his age by 5. The number you will receive and will be the number of minutes your puppy can walk for one walk on a leash, and apply this scheme for puppies from 3 to 12 months. </p>
<p> Up to 3 months, the puppy does not recommend walking on a leash at all! <p>
<p> At 3 months, a puppy can walk on a leash 15 minutes a day. Start walking on a simple leash (not a roulette at all) and walk only on a good surface (land, grass, sandy road, but NOT asphalt, concrete, ice) gradually increasing the time for walking. </p>
<p> At 6 months, 30 minutes a day. This will give you the opportunity to introduce the puppy to the world of cars, people and all the sounds of everyday life. If you walk in the park, then drive the dog to the park and back. </p>
<p> At 10 months - 50 minutes a day. </p>
<p> From 12 to 18 months, Golden can walk a maximum of 1 hour on a leash. </p>
<p> Do not walk with the puppy for more than the specified time. Walking so, you minimize the risk of all orthopedic diseases. </p>
<p style = "color: #993300; text-transform: uppercase;"> Bicycle </p>
<p> The puppy is NOT allowed to run for the bike or follow you on rollers for up to 18 months. </p>
<p style = "color: #993300; text-transform: uppercase;"> Appliance </p>
<p> Dog retrieval is required, but be careful. For example, do not throw a dammy on 20 meters 10 times in a row to a small puppy. We believe that a dog needs play games from a very young age in order for it to grow into a real “dual-purpose” (Note: dual-use dogs that would be successful both at shows and in work) dog, but Remember that you cannot do a single-game puppy or a single occupation. Also always make sure that the coating is suitable. </p>
<p> For a puppy up to 6 months, do not throw a dummy, but roll it on the ground. </p>
<p> Starting at 6 months, you can throw a dummy, as far as you can, so that the puppy does not jump up and run. Do not use frisbees for up to 12 months. </p>
<p> In brief: no distant ports up to 3 months, between 3 and 12 months, multiply the puppy's age by 2, and the resulting number is the number of minutes that a puppy can be busy picking up per day, divided into several sessions. </p>
<p style = "color: #993300; text-transform: uppercase;"> GAMES WITH OTHER PUPPIES </p>
<p> Playing with other puppies of the same age and size is very useful and allowed without restrictions. </p>
<p style = "color: #993300; text-transform: uppercase;"> JUMPING </p>
<p> A puppy up to 8 months old cannot jump higher than his wrist. From 8 months - a puppy can jump to the height of his elbow. All games where the puppy will jump higher are prohibited for up to 12 months. </p>
<p style = "color: #993300; text-transform: uppercase;"> FREE MOVEMENT </p>
<p> Free movement is a great exercise for a puppy and you can let the puppy move freely, as much as he wants, only when the puppy is alone! Around there should not be other dogs, children and so on. A puppy should always have free choice when to stop. If the puppy is in the company, then he passes his limits! </p>
<p style = "color: #993300; text-transform: uppercase;"> NEXT </p>
<p> This is definitely a good and safe exercise to teach your puppy to use natural flair. It should start with a simple one: lay out a treat at a short distance from each other at a short distance and give the command “search!”, Following the puppy from one treat to another. Do not make the trail too complicated and long, until the puppy is 12 months old. </p>
<p style = "color: #993300; text-transform: uppercase;"> SWIMMING </p>
<p> This is a safe and excellent physically developing puppy exercise, if you follow some rules: </p>
<p> - the shore should be shallow. A steep, slippery beach is dangerous for a puppy! </p>
<p> - do not throw the puppy a toy so that it often jumps out of the water behind it. </p>
<p> - do not let your puppy overwork. </p>
<p> - Never leave your dog wet overnight. If the wool is not dry, it should be dried. </p>
<p> Your 6 month old (and older) puppy can stay in the water for as long as he wants, provided the water warms up well and the day is warm and sunny enough. </p>
<p style = "color: #993300; text-transform: uppercase; font-weight: bold;"> VERY IMPORTANT! </p>
<p> 1. Forget about training your dog's endurance until he or she is 18 months old. </p>
<p> 2. Do not allow adult dogs or people to set the pace of the puppy and provoke the game again and again. This can lead to fatigue and tragic consequences in the future. </p>
<p> 3. Do not allow your puppy to jump in or out of the car. Take it and carry it on your hands. </p>
<p> 4. No stairs for up to 12 months! There is nothing worse for a puppy's paw than to let it run up and down the stairs. If you need to climb with the puppy up the stairs, take him in your arms. </p>
<p> 5. If, during exercise, your puppy stopped and sat down, you should finish the lesson. Your task is to learn to finish classes when the puppy is still active and satisfied with himself, and not when he is tired and sluggish. Do not let the puppy become exhausted while walking! </p>
<p> 6. Do not allow any energetic games before and immediately after a meal! </p>
<p> 7. Never allow children to play with a puppy for more than 5 minutes and unattended. Usually these games end in tragedy! PUPPY IS NOT A TOY FOR A CHILD !!! </p>
<p> 8. Follow your puppy condition. It should be remembered that the puppy's excessive weight loads not only the joints, but also the heart! </p>
<p> 9. For those who are going to take part in competitions with their dog later, whether it is hunting, IPO, agility or any other sport, remember that a puppy can easily lose interest in classes if you make him do a lot of work and for a long time and monotonous practice exercises. </p>
<p> Also, too long workouts carry the risk of physical overload, small subluxations or sprains, which can be imperceptible to the human eye, but can cause serious problems for your puppy or even be accompanied by pain. </p>
<p> Thus, besides the fact that the puppy may develop health problems, he will still associate work with pain and therefore at an older age will not like to work. This does not mean that training should be completely removed from the schedule of your puppy. Just once again we want to emphasize how much you need to be careful in the amount of physical activity for a puppy dog under the age of one year. </p>
