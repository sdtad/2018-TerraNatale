	<p>As you pick up a puppy from a mother, you become responsible for teaching him his daily life. During socialization, you gradually and carefully introduce your pet to things that are new and new to him, sounds, and different situations. Socialization is designed to help your dog successfully integrate not only into human society, but also into the society of animals around it.</p>
	</div>
</div><br>
<p> Dogs that were not socialized properly in their youth, often grow into cowardly, unsure dogs that don’t know how to behave in the simplest situations. As a result, being under constant stress, the dog gradually becomes aggressive, since it is a natural defensive reaction of the animal to events that are incomprehensible to him. </p>
<p> Other non-socialized puppies can grow into hyperactive, restless dogs, which, due to their lack of balance, will have big behavioral problems. During socialization, a young dog gradually gains everyday experience, learning to distinguish between dangerous and safe and control their behavior. </p>
<p> Thus, an adult dog will calmly, without anxiety, perceive new phenomena and situations. </p>
<p> Carefully thoughtful socialization of your puppy will help him grow into an obedient, calm and confident dog. </p>

<h2> At what age should socialization be started? </h2>
<p> Puppy socialization usually begins immediately after his birth, when the mother begins to teach the puppies about the order in the pack and communication between dogs. The best age for the start of socialization of puppies by man is from 4 to 12 weeks. </p>
<p> At this age they are most susceptible to learning. </p>
<p> If you bought a puppy from a professional breeder, then it is likely that he has already started socializing your puppy in order to prepare him for the transition to the new owners in the best possible way. Therefore, always ask the breeder if he has begun the socialization of your puppy and what he has already introduced him to. Having taken a puppy from a breeder, you will continue its socialization. </p>
<p> If your puppy is not yet completely vaccinated after his birth, then it is important not to walk with him in places where other unvaccinated dogs may be located. Communication with a sick dog at this stage can be fatal for a puppy. Therefore, until all vaccinations are given to the puppy, the best and safe place for his socialization will be your home and garden. Your breeder should give your puppy a primary vaccination, which will be able to protect him for a while, but after that you need to vaccinate the puppy again, which you should consult with your veterinarian about. After the second vaccination, your puppy will be completely protected to walk with him, anywhere. </p>
<p> Before the secondary vaccination, your puppy can be introduced to the items in your home and garden. Then start walking with the puppy outside the house and the garden so that he can see other dogs and gain experience. </p>
<p> But be extremely careful and do not let him close to the dogs. </p>
<p> Before the age of 12 weeks, the puppy needs to be introduced to many new and unknown objects and objects, as well as to show as many different people and dogs as possible. You can take him in your arms (so as not to get sick) and travel with him to busy places, such as the avenue, the bazaar or the store, so that he can look around, listen to new sounds, see strangers, shopping carts, vendors at the bazaar and etc. Show the puppy to the postman or other people dressed in uniforms and ask them to let your puppy sniff them. This will help explain to your puppy that in the arrival of the postman to the door of your house there is nothing terrible and you should not bark at it. It is very useful to stand with him near a busy highway or at a traffic light, let him watch and listen to the movement of cars. </p>
<p> If the puppy is calm, then it should be praised and give a treat. But do not praise or shout at him if he is nervous, on the contrary, talk to him in a calm voice to calm him down. If you have friends who have vaccinated dogs, it would be helpful to let your puppy play with them in your home or in your own garden. After the second vaccination of the puppy, you can begin to more socialization. </p>
<p> Now you have to go for a walk with him on walks farther from home. Go with him to the park, where he will see a lot of new and unknown dogs, or to the beach so that he can run around enjoying the sand and waves. </p>
<p> Try to show your puppy a variety of people: tall, low, fat and thin, who have a mustache or a beard, wear glasses, hats, scarves, umbrellas or walking sticks, walk with baby strollers, etc. </p>
<p> Let your puppy listen to various sounds, for example, sirens of special vehicles, car and telephone hooters, children's cries, barking of other dogs, the roar of airplanes, loud music, fireworks, squeals of brakes, cat meows, and thunder. </p>
<p> Do not limit yourself to this list, there are many new things that your puppy should learn. </p>
<p> Socialize your puppy daily and gradually, and don’t expect too much from him at such a young age. </p>
<p> Socialization lessons should be short and interesting, otherwise the puppy will become bored. Young dogs can not long concentrate on one thing. With socialization, it would be useful to outline a lesson plan. </p>
<p> Let your puppy learn something new every day, but no more than 3-4 new impressions per day. If the puppy remains calm, then do not forget to praise and give him a treat. </p>
<p> Every week, go back to your classes to reinforce the lessons learned by the puppy. </p>
<p> But do not dwell on the same thing - offer him all sorts of options. </p>

<p> Carry it by car, visit other homes or places you are allowed to go with dogs. </p>
<p> Try to get your puppy to meet different people every day. </p>
<h3> What if the puppy is very afraid? </h3>
<p> If your puppy is frightened or nervous at the sight of something harmless, for example, an open umbrella, then try to speak kindly with him to calm him down. If you worry yourself, it can only strengthen his fear, because you confirm his suspicions that he has reason to fear. </p>
<p> You are a man and you know more, so you must show him that there is no reason for fear. </p>
<p> Do not try to force the puppy to push to the umbrella - it will only get worse. Instead, close the umbrella and lay it on the floor. </p>
<p> Sit near the umbrella, but do not touch it, and even - do not look. A puppy's natural curiosity will make him come closer to him and sniff. If this happens, then praise him. In the next lesson, open the umbrella in half and place a towel inside it to further heat the puppy's curiosity. Shake the edge of the towel in front of the puppy's nose. </p>
<p> When the puppy begins to play with the towel and relax, try to carefully open the umbrella until the end, put it on the floor, and finally, slowly lift it over your head. When you acquaint your puppy with something new and, in his opinion, “terrible”, act very carefully, gradually increasing the intensity of studying the object or phenomenon, until the puppy is no longer afraid or nervous. Do not forget to praise and reward your puppy with a treat. </p>
<p> Puppy training in a dog training group is an excellent addition to the socialization process. </p>
<p> It will allow your pet to communicate with other puppies and their owners. </p>
<p> Your breeder or local dog club can recommend you such a group of dogs. </p>
<p> However, in order to train in a group, your puppy should already be vaccinated again. </p>
<p> Together with the socialization of a puppy, you need to train him in good manners so that he knows which behavior is acceptable and which one is not. It is also necessary to start teaching the puppy obedience and teach it to the main teams, for example, “sit”, “stand”, “cannot”, “come to me”, etc. </p>
