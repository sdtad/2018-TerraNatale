<p> Labrador is called the king of retrievers. He vividly reacts to everything, is confident in his abilities and is stubborn in achieving the goal. He finds and aportiruet bat game both on land and in water. It has a remarkable visual memory, it can remember the places of falling of several birds at once. Balanced, never shows aggression, is considered one of the most devoted dogs. It needs skillful guidance and gentle training. The intelligence of Labradors is not inferior to nobility and devotion. It seems that they are born to enjoy life and love it. And this love Labrador is ready to share generously with everyone! When raising a Labrador Retriever, there is no need to constantly prove "who is the boss", they never claim leadership. </p>
<center><img src="<?php print $siteurleng;?>img/articles/articles1-1.jpg"></center>
<p> At first they were fearless sailors, then tireless hunters and have long been pleased to cope with the role of a companion dog. And in recent decades, thanks to his intuition, patience, selfless devotion to man, the Labrador has become an excellent guide for the blind and an assistant for the deaf. </p>
<p> Excellent scent in combination with irrepressible curiosity made Labrador retrievers one of the best for searching for drugs and explosives and an unsurpassed assistant to rescue teams during accidents and natural disasters. </p>
<p> Abroad Labrador for many years used as dogs - therapists. They are specially trained to communicate with sick people, including children. The results of such communication are simply phenomenal. </p>
<p> Labs - therapists help epileptics. They anticipate the beginning of a seizure and warn a person to go to a safe place. Loyalty and understanding with their owners are extraordinary! </p>
<p> There is another profession in Labrador Retriever - a dog-policeman. </p>
<p> Such a dog must find, seize and detain the criminal. Many may be horrified by such a thought (after all, this is a Labrador!), But you need to understand that a Labrador Retriever refers to such work as a game and performs it absolutely without aggression. </p>
<p> It is precisely because of the absence of malice and hyper-irritability in many countries that the police choose to work with Labradors. Their excellent work is not dictated by bloodthirstiness, but by devotion and the desire to be useful to the owner. And the search and rescue service on the water as if specially created for the Labrador - a born swimmer, able to work even in icy water! </p>
<p> Opportunities and talents, intelligence and amazing spiritual qualities of a Labrador Retriever are difficult to overestimate. </p>
<p> Labradors have a single “flaw” - too much trust and friendliness. And the owners of Labrador retrievers should always remember that not all dogs, and people too, have a similar “flaw”. </p>
<center><img src="<?php print $siteurleng;?>img/articles/articles1-2.jpg"></center>
<p> It can live in an apartment, provided long active walks. It is necessary to brush wool 2–3 times a week, to comb it out during shedding. </p>
<p> Labrador is a tough, but tough, elegant. From the very beginning, the breed was bred for work and retained the physical form necessary for this. Labrador's anatomy fits its purpose: powerful jaws created for fitting game, short dense coat with thick undercoat, protecting from the cold and almost waterproof - even if the dog gets dirty, after the wool dries, all the dirt “rolls” off it, webbed feet and otter tail, facilitating movement in water. </p>
<center><img src="<?php print $siteurleng;?>img/articles/articles1-3.jpg"></center>
<p> A Labrador has rounded ribs (even a puppy), but must be compact and, preferably, without extra weight. Often, veterinarians unfamiliar with the specificity of the breed, prescribed a lightweight diet, where it is absolutely not necessary. However, if a Labrador gets overweight, then this is from a wrong lifestyle. For urban Labrador, the “sofa - pavement - sofa” mode is typical, but not useful. Still, it is better to add a little bit of daily exercise and continue to give a normal diet: if it is dry food, then a little less - but in no case no more than the manufacturer suggests, if these are natural products, then no more than 600 grams of meat, rice and vegetables. And remember - the only drawback of a Labrador is that he loves to eat! </p>
<h3> Labrador Retriever Standard Comment </h3>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">GENERAL FORM</p>
<center><iframe width="280" height="170" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z4eZhdt9Ibs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
<p> A Labrador Retriever is a strong, strong, strong-boned dog that, however, should not look too raw. The condition of the Labrador should give him the opportunity to work effectively with aportirovki, jump over obstacles, swim against a strong current and have enough endurance to repeat it more than once during the day. Those who, when breeding, do not take into account these requirements, receive either individuals with a poor anatomical structure, too light, not having sufficient strength and energy for hard work on aportirovka, or extremely heavy and loaded dogs that quickly get tired. We must remember that the Standard assumes that the dog must perform its main function: to aport, and if we decide to have dogs of this breed and breed them, we must consider their potential as working dogs, even if we are sure that our dogs will never participate in field trials. </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold;"> HEAD </p>
<p> The skull should be wide, the stop point is well defined. Cheeks are not friable, too wet cheeks give the dog a face that is not characteristic of Labrador. The muzzle should be of medium length, making it possible to feed the game. A narrow gable is not desirable. The nose should be large, with well-developed nostrils, which guarantees the dog's excellent sense of smell. </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold;"> EARS </p>
<p> The ears are far enough away and should be set low. With a high set of ears, the head loses the typical expression inherent in the breed. Ears of the correct size should be tightly pressed to the head. </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold;"> EYES </p>
<p> The eyes are set fairly wide, and should not be round or convex, because such eyes are too vulnerable for a working dog. We seek to see small, oval-shaped eyes in the Labrador that do not sit too deep. The color can vary from nutty to dark brown, preferably the color of "burnt sugar". In America, black eyes are allowed, but in the UK they look askance. Be that as it may, the most important thing here is the expression of the eyes: they must express good temperament and kindness. A ferocious look is not allowed. </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold;"> JAWS </p>
<p> Both English and American standards characterize the dental system as a “full and regular scissor bite,” which means that the top row of teeth faces the bottom without a gap. The teeth are located in the jaw symmetrically and vertically. The number of teeth is not specified. </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold;"> NECK AND FRONT </p>
<p> The structure of the neck and front limbs are important for the dog, because determine the nature of the movement. </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold;"> NECK </p>
<p> We want to see a labrador with a strong neck, no dewlap, with a good exit and the correct angle of the shoulder. </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold;"> FOREQUARTERS </p>
<p> The shoulder blades and shoulder are set obliquely, not short, the articulation angle is about 90. The correct angle of the shoulder-blade articulation is necessary so that during game the main weight falls on the shoulder and not on the neck or jaw. When viewed from the front and side, the front legs should be straight, not long, well muscled and with strong bones. Pasterns are strong, slightly sloping, but not “soft.” </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold;"> BREED </p>
<p> The chest should be so wide that the male palm passes between the forelimbs. Seen from the side, the brisket is at the level of the dog’s elbow. </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold;"> BODY </p>
<p> A Labrador Retriever should be well developed with arched ribs. rib cage. The loin is short, strong, wide. Topline is level. </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold;"> REAR LIMBS </p>
<p> The hind limbs are well muscled, with well defined corners and hocks. When viewed from the rear hock joints are straight and parallel. Korovin - a serious drawback. Hind limbs with irregular angles will give a bad push when moving. With proper movement, it seems that the hind limbs forcefully push off from the surface. </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold;"> WOOL, TAIL </p>
<p> Two of the most characteristic signs for the breed and this is noted in the standard. If the coat is formed correctly, you will see at the Labrador that characteristic otter tail. There should be no suspension on the tail: the tail is very thick at the base and tapers towards the end. The British, like the American Standard, defines the length as "medium". Too long or short tails disturb the overall balance of the dog. The tail long to the hock creates a pleasant impression. The tail should be at the level of the back, but often Labradors carry it higher. This is defined by the Standard as a “fun raised tail,” but the tail should never be thrown over its back — this is considered a serious shortcoming. Wool should be short and thick, rather rough to the touch. If you push the guard hair apart, you should see a thick, soft, waterproof undercoat covering the entire body of the dog. It may be a lighter shade than the main hair. Many excellent black dogs have a mouse-colored undercoat. Soft wool is considered a big disadvantage for a Labrador, since does not repel water. Although the American Standard does not emphasize the value of the undercoat, American Labradors are characterized by very good wool quality and excellent otter tails. </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold;"> COLOR </p>
<p> Three colors are allowed: black, fawn and chocolate. Black: A small white spot on the chest is acceptable. Eye color should match the color: preferred brown or nutty. Fawn: This term defines the gamut of colors from red to light cream. We object to blackout on the face of fawn dogs, such as a mask that gives them an atypical expression. A small white spot on the chest is permissible. Eye color is the same as that of black, with black or dark brown pigmentation around the eyes and lips. The nose in winter can lose pigmentation to pink, this is not a disadvantage. Chocolate: all shades are allowed from light to dark. Dark color with dark eyes is preferred. Eye color should match the color. </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold;"> TRAFFIC </p>
<p> Movements are very important for a Labrador - they should be light and free. With the right structure, the animal will move correctly. The straightness of the movement lies in the fact that when driving on you, you should only see the movement of the front limbs. When driving away from you - only the rear. The movements should not be too sweeping or mincing. </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold;"> GROWTH </p>
<p> Once again, the small differences between the British and American standards: Americans admit slightly higher growth limits. However, an experienced expert will single out a dog, even if it is slightly above the permissible standard, provided that it is harmonious and balanced. As one of the most famous breeders of this breed notes: “A Labrador should only remind you of a Labrador. If he looks like a dog of another breed, he is not typical.” </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold;"> TEMPERAMENT </p>
<p> There is no breed superior to Labrador temperament. Labrador has a big, noble soul and is always kind to people, especially to small children. Good temperament, calmness and intelligence make this breed one of the most suitable for such service as a guide for the blind, a police dog and we should be grateful to those who developed this breed before us and those who continue to maintain these traits today. Any dog, no matter how good the exterior is, if it shows an unstable temperament in the ring or in the pits, it must be immediately disqualified. </p>

<p> Labrador is a sociable dog that does not lock itself on one member of the family, it loves everyone around it. Labrador quickly learns the habits of people and firmly enters their lives. He is able to work and make decisions independently, which is especially important in extreme conditions and during a hunt. This dog feels the danger threatening the people she loves, and tries to protect and protect them. Labrador gets on well with other animals, loves children with whom he likes to play, and walks around as a reliable guard: these dogs have a rather impressive appearance. besides, Labrador has an intuition, and he always observes that his friends do not get into trouble. The value of a Labrador friendship is hard to overestimate. </p>
