	<p> Basics of dog reproduction</p>
	<p>Determining the optimal time for mating is an integral part of the daily practice of a veterinary reproductive therapist. However, general practitioners often face the task of correctly determining the time of mating, but they do not always know which methods can help them in this. At the moment there are several available and relevant methods for determining the optimal fertile period in females, each of which has its own characteristics and degree of reliability. In some cases, their use may not only be useful, but even a necessary diagnostic step in examining a patient. Vershinina (Nazarova) Ekaterina Nikolaevna, full member of the Society for Veterinary Reproduction, a practicing veterinarian - reproductologist and an expert in ultrasound diagnostics of the veterinary clinic "Kolibri" (Dolgoprudny, Moscow Region), will tell all of this in detail in her video lecture.</p>
