	<p>Very often, we ask the question: “What kind of food is good?” <br> And in fact, the answer to it is incredibly simple: <br> The food that fits this particular dog is good. <br> And for each dog, it may be a completely different feed.</p>
	</div>
</div><br>
<p> Immediately draw an analogy: Let's take an object like an ordinary kitchen knife. Is the knife itself good or bad? </p>
<p> He is no, he is just a thing, just a knife. We can use it for its intended purpose and prepare sandwiches and salads for the arrival of guests, but just as well, we can hide in the hallway and pierce all the balloons that guest wighed at the birthday party. The result is completely different, the knife is the same. The same with feed. </p>
<p> All Feed is just feed. </p>
<p> Super premium food is all high quality. </p>
<p> But if they fit our dog, we can find out only through trial and error. </p>
<p> What does feed mean? This means that the dog looks good, she has shiny hair, she has clean ears and eyes, she is in good shape. All superpremium line feeds are of high quality, that is, in principle, good. </p>
<p> Yes, that's it. But each of them has slightly different composition, slightly different ingredients, but this does not make them suitable or not suitable. Every organism is individual. Even if we take odomentals, they will still have different organisms, and it’s not at all a fact that the same food will do for them. Therefore, when choosing food, you should not base your decision on the feedback from other people, because it means nothing to your dog specifically. </p>
<p> Food needs to be selected individually, based precisely on the appearance and well-being of your dog. </p>
<p> But you need to remember a few things: Food with lots of protein is only suitable for working dogs, which really work and only in moments of stress. For example, a Retriever who works 5 days a week in a field can eat a high-protein food. Or a dog that engages in winter sports can eat high-protein food at this point. But in all other cases, high-protein food will be harmful to the dog, and you will see it by the type of hair, flowing ears and eyes. </p>
<p> Puppies of large breeds are also harmful to grow on high-protein feed, so it is better to grow puppies of large breeds not on feed for large breeds (they have too high content of protein and fat), but on feed for adult dogs, or on feed for medium breeds. </p>
<p> If we feed a large breed puppy with high-protein feed, it grows too fast, and this is an excessive load on the joints, which leads to acquired dysplasia, ramming, cows. </p>
<p> Moreover, a large breed puppy is somehow better to convert to adult food in 4-5 months, precisely in order not to allow it to grow too fast. For a puppy of a large breed, it is necessary for health to grow slowly and evenly, and a puppy of a large breed will be ready only for 3-4 years. And that's fine. If you force a puppy to grow too fast using high-protein food, you are harming its health. What is the optimal ratio of protein and fat for most breeds in feed? For most breeds, this ratio will be no more than 25-26% of protein (protein) and no more than 12-13% of fat. But, for many, it will be too much. For example, if the food is on chicken or lamb, the best option is 23% protein and 10-11% fat. If the feed on fish - you can increase the protein to 25-26%. </p>
<p> And now we move to different sources of protein (protein). In nature, a dog or a wolf has a very diverse diet. But for some reason, many nutritionists, although it is better to say marketers, feed manufacturers advise us to feed the dog all my life with one feed. And there is no bigger mistake than following the advice of marketers in this case. </p>
<p> A dog should receive a varied diet, because for the health of the dog, it is necessary to give it proteins from different sources. The most healthy method of feeding will be a change of feed every 2-3 months, so that the dog receives poultry, meat, fish. And just as well, the amount and percentage of protein and fat in the feed should be changed every couple of months. A healthy dog, without any problems, moves from one feed to another simply because it is natural. Where have you seen a wolf that would gradually, for several days, change food from poultry to meat? If we feed a dog for too long with the same food, we will ultimately always deal with the following problems: Rozovlenie or pooryzhe wool, lack of luster wool, and poor general condition. </p>
<p> Often, seeing this, we start talking - apparently the food has spoiled, before everything was fine, and now what happens. </p>
<p> A dog simply cannot eat the same food all the time, and if we feed the dog for years with the same food, then the dog is allergic to the same source of protein. Likewise, we often notice - they transferred the dog to another feed - it all shone, in excellent condition and we think - Oh, what a wonderful feed. Again, the wrong conclusion. </p>
<p> This feed is no better than before, we just changed the source of protein. </p>
<p> I would also like to touch on a very "sick" topic of natural nutrition. There are many supporters of natural nutrition. So what is better "naturalka" or "drying"? The answer to this question is again very simple: well, the method of nutrition that suits your dog specifically. But, very often, people call “naturalka” simply unhealthy food for the dog. Useful naturalka for dogs is: as the main ingredient raw meat, scar, poultry, fish, vegetables and fruits in small quantities and poultry carcasses, these or other bones (of course, not fish and not tubular from poultry.) </p>
<p> Useful naturalka is also the FULL absence of cereals, and any starchy foods, lack of broth or a boiled source of protein, no liver from any animal in the diet, and naturally no human foods. Why not give sausages, cakes and others like them? </p>
<p> For a person, there is food - suitable for him, but there is food in principle not suitable. </p>
<p> For example, how will our guests look at us if we present on their plate a raw, unpeeled scar with a smell? </p>
<p> I think at best the guests will smile and take it as a failed joke, right? </p>
<p> Giving the dog sausages, cakes and other products of this type, we do the same as if we gave our dear guests a raw, unpeeled scar with the best intentions for the New Year))) That is, a dog is not a person, but a person - not a dog. For each of us, some kind of food is suitable, but some kind is not. </p>
<p> I will not go deep into the topic which is better - dry or natural food. My personal opinion is that dry food is preferable because natural food should be perfectly balanced, and only a dog nutritionist can balance a natural food, or a person who has very thoughtfully approached this issue and has a lot of experience. There are few such people, and therefore, in my opinion, it is most preferable that our dog is suitable, dry food. Also, I want to note that there are more dogs coming to me for a consultation with gastrointestinal problems, allergies, eczema, among those who eat natural food. I keep statistics for many years. Maybe you will be surprised, my personal statistics over the years is such that 80% of problem dogs on natural food, then only 25% of them on dry food. Big difference isn't it? But I want to repeat, the problem is not in natural nutrition, but in the imbalance of natural nutrition, which is obtained by the majority of people who feed a naturalk. </p>
<p> What exactly is extremely harmful for a dog is mixed food. And according to my statistics, the most of all health problems in mixed-nutrition dogs. Why? Because the dog's digestive tract works differently digesting dry food and natural. When we begin to give a mixed diet, the digestive tract is not adjusted to any food, therefore, in the first place, the gastrointestinal tract and the liver give problems (and the problem of the gastrointestinal tract and liver is the problem of eczema, poor hair, molting, the immune system, etc.), and secondly, due to the fact that the gastrointestinal tract does not digest food properly, the dog does not absorb a sufficient and correct and balanced amount of nutrients necessary for healthy life, which only exacerbates the problem. </p>
<p> More specifically: to digest natural food, the gastrointestinal tract produces a certain sort of enzymes that help digest and absorb food. </p>
<p> To digest dry food, the digestive tract produces completely different enzymes that in turn help to assimilate dry food. Giving mixed feed, the gastrointestinal tract does not emit any kind of enzymes of the correct type and in sufficient quantity, in connection with which the work of the gastrointestinal tract is completely disordered and the body does not absorb the necessary nutrients from food. </p>
<p> The most unfortunate and dangerous option is when a puppy gets mixed food up to a year. By giving the puppy food in the morning, and in the evening meat or cottage cheese, we completely unbalance calcium - phosphorus balance and completely disrupt the exchange of substances, and these are problems with ODA, problems with wool, problems with development in general. To my great regret, a lot of puppies in Russia get exactly mixed food, with all the attendant problems. </p>
<p> Summarizing the above: </p>
<p> - All super premium class food quality. </p>
<p> - A good food is the one that suits your dog. </p>
<p> - For healthy functioning of the body, you need to change the source of protein in the feed every few months. </p>
<p> - High protein food is not good for most dogs. </p>
<p> - Mixed food is bad for all dogs. </p>
<p> - Natural food should be balanced, and should not contain pasta, porridge, sausages, liver, cooked meat, poultry, and human food from the table in the form of sausage, cakes, smoked fish, cheese, curd masses, etc. </p> <br>
