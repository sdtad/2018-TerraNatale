	<p>Chewing is quite normal for a puppy, especially when his teeth are cut (about 4 months). However, at the age of 3 to 6 months, you can begin to “explain” to your puppy that you cannot nibble at home. A puppy must understand that he can be chewed, and that - no. Otherwise, he will assume that he can gnaw absolutely everything.</p>

	<p>A lot of articles and books have been written about dog training, while they say little or very little about the time when the puppy started learning. And this is very important. It is necessary to take into account that all puppies even from one litter develop differently, and therefore their readiness for learning is also different. If the owner or trainer does not take this into account, then the dog can be trained very slowly or with big problems and overloads for the puppy's unstable psyche.</p>

	<p>You have acquired a puppy and a true friend and how it will grow now depends on you and on your respect for the dog. Remember that the first year of life is the most important stage in the development of the organism and the character of the dog. <br> You are the owners of the puppy from the moment of purchase. Accordingly, only you make all the decisions on his fate. The advice of the others, including our advice, is advisory. However, try to listen to them, as these tips are based on many years of experience of dog handlers and recommendations of veterinarians. Before you go to pick up a puppy, you must prepare for his appearance in your home. Choose a place to sleep and feed him. The puppy will need toys, bowls, a leash with a collar. A first-aid medical kit and more are also needed...</p>
