	<p>Calcium is one of the main building elements in the body of both humans and animals. <br> It is responsible for blood clotting, muscle contraction, and the excitability of the nervous system. Many are worried about the lack of calcium in the body, but few people think about its excess, and this is important because with a lack of calcium, puppies can develop rickets, growth retardation, delayed tooth replacement, and with an excess - osteochondrosis, hypertrophic osteodystrophy, curvature of the radial bones and other diseases. Therefore, it is necessary to remember that there needs a middle ground.</p>

<p> A calcium bank is bone, which consists of a very hard "compact" outer part and an inner "brain" - mainly a proteinaceous substance, in which calcium from blood is accumulated by means of special cells, causing calcification (saturation of the body with calcium). </p>
<p> The decrease in the exchange fund (labile component) of the bone mineral substance is a consequence of a change in the hormonal status of the body due to various reasons. Three hormones are responsible for maintaining normal blood calcium levels: parathyrin or parathyroid hormone (parathyroid hormone), calcitonin and cholecalciferol (vitamin D).</p>
<p> Paratirin is most important for pregnant and lactating. Interacting with calcitonin, parathyrin regulates the level of calcium and phosphorus in the blood, tissue fluid and bone tissue. When the level of calcium in the blood is low, parathyrin enhances the function of osteoclasts (cells that destroy bone tissue during its rearrangements), which contributes to the demineralization of bone and an increase in the level of calcium in blood plasma. When ingested with food, calcium from the intestine is absorbed into the blood through parathyroid hormone (parathyroid hormone). The versatility of the metabolic system allows, if necessary, to return calcium back into the blood, taking it from the bone. However, calcium is needed not only and not so much for the formation and strengthening of bone tissue. The main vital functions of calcium are to provide the necessary level of blood clotting, support normal muscle contraction, including cardiac. </p>
<p> That’s why bones suffer first. The problems associated with calcium overload are less well known, although calcium overload is even more dangerous than its deficiency. Owners of large breed puppies often tolerate an overdose of calcium, thinking they are doing the right thing. Excess calcium in the diet leads to metabolic disorders in the body, which prevents the normal growth of the dog. In this regard, the experiments conducted by Dr. Hazenwinkel are very revealing. </p>
<p> He compares the development of mastiff puppies who received different amounts of calcium in the diet: </p>
<p> - 5 puppies received 1.1% calcium; </p>
<p> - 6 puppies received 3.3% calcium. </p>
<p> Puppies that received 3.3% of calcium (excess), were stunted, had a poor appetite, and had a poorly positioned limb due to bone deformation. An excess of calcium leads to a violation of the absorption of zinc, which may be the cause of skin diseases. In addition, an overdose of calcium causes hypertrophy of the gastric mucosa and atony of the pylorus are risk factors for the dog's stomach to turn. </p>
<p> With constant excess calcium intake, the release of parathyroid hormone decreases, and as a result, the bone and cartilage system ceases to form normally: the bones thicken and thicken. </p>
<p> Cartilage tissue, the maturation of which is delayed, is subjected to unreasonably high mechanical stress associated with physical activity and possible excess weight, which reduces its strength. Difficulties in bone tissue changes and an increasing decrease in the strength of cartilage tissue can cause pain and serious disorders in the musculoskeletal system: osteochondrosis, exfoliating osteochondritis, compression of the spine ... Most often, these disorders occur and occur more severely in fast-growing large breeds. An excess of calcium in the feed also complicates the absorption of other macro- and oligo-elements: phosphorus, magnesium, copper, zinc ... Thus, an excess of calcium can cause secondary deficiency of these elements. Cartilage, the maturation of which is delayed, is subjected to unreasonably high mechanical stress associated with physical activity and possible excess weight, which reduces their strength. </p>
<p> The difficulty of bone changes and the increasing fragility of cartilage can cause pain and serious musculoskeletal disorders; osteochondrosis, dissecting osteochondritis, compression of the spine ... Excess calcium in feed or supplements also complicates the absorption of other minerals and trace elements: phosphorus, magnesium, copper, zinc. </p>
<p> Thus, a surplus of calcium can cause secondary deficiency in these elements. It was also proven slowing maturation of cartilage and skeletal formation. Dogs that are given too much calcium may experience degeneration of the spinal cord, as well as other abnormalities. </p>
<p> At the same time, in dogs that did not receive calcium supplements, normal maturation of cartilage occurs and no degeneration of the spinal cord was found. A survey of German dogs fully confirmed the observations of Dr. Lewis, who conducted a similar survey of Dobermans in England. </p>
<p> Were investigated 142 X-rays Dobermans, thanks to the survey was able to establish a complete objective picture of the nutrition of dogs. More than 80% of the dogs receiving calcium overload had mild or severe abnormalities in the structure of the cervical vertebrae. An excess of calcium in the dog's body leads to enhanced</p>
<p> In puppies, growth zones are closed, pathologies of the musculoskeletal system are possible. </p>
<p> Excess calcium leads to brittle blood vessels, reducing the elasticity of the heart muscle. Older dogs, as it is not strange, to osteoporosis. (Desorption (destruction) of calcium from bone tissue begins with an excess of calcium in the blood.) </p>
<p> In nature, wolves provide themselves with minerals, crushing the bones of animals (meat contains little calcium), the owners decide for pets, giving them calcium-containing feedings in large quantities a priori. </p>
<p> These feeds may include chalk, shell rock, chelated calcium and other sources of calcium. Dog owners are thus trying to provide the body of their pets with minerals and calcium. </p>
<p> However, this calcium is not absorbed by the dog’s body. Not to mention that the lack of calcium in the body arises not from its insufficient consumption with food (there is enough calcium in professional foods), but from an imbalance that does not allow the body to absorb and retain calcium. Mineral substances can benefit only when an adequate amount of acceptors of these components of nutrition with other metabolites is formed in the body's metabolism, and the exchange of the organic matrix of bone tissue is synchronized with the general mineral metabolism. Excessive intake of calcium-containing supplements, improper nutrition, an overdose of vitamin D, disturbances in the hormonal regulatory systems - all this causes an excess of calcium in the dog's body. Is a calcium overload with mineral supplements dangerous for a dog? Some dog owners believe that an excess of calcium is excreted from the dog’s body without wearing harm. In fact, it is not. </p>
<p> As mentioned earlier, calcium oversupply is even more dangerous than its deficiency. Opinion Lowell Ackerman - a veterinarian and a dietitian consultant. In the past, the editor of Advances in Nutrition has authored 60 books and more than 150 articles. </p>
<p> He lectures on nutrition in the USA, Canada and Europe. DVM, Ph.D. "There is one trap that should be avoided when growing a puppy - it is supplements of vitamins and minerals. </p>
<p> It’s easy to become a fan of vitamin and mineral supplements, but it’s not wise. Most of the mistakes in growing puppies are due to unreasonable supplements containing calcium, phosphorus and / or vitamin D. </p>
<p> You can assume that these supplements will help your puppy grow by adding additional calcium to its resources. </p>
<p> In the end, we encourage children to drink milk so that they have strong teeth and bones. Why not puppies? </p>
<p> The reason is that the normal growth of a puppy depends on the ideal proportions of calcium and phosphorus; </p>
<p> This is usually about 1.3 parts calcium to 1 part phosphorus. </p>
<p> This is the optimal ratio for healthy bone growth. This balance can be easily upset by adding calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, or combinations of these to the diet. There is much evidence that these supplements are the cause of many bone deformities seen in growing dogs. "The question arises: a lot of calcium is bad, a little is bad too, so what should we do? And the answer lies on the surface: to find a middle ground, that is, to normalize the work of the organism as a whole. </p>
<p> To pass a blood test for calcium-phosphorus + urine for calcium-phosphorus. And then decide whether the puppy needs calcium. </p>
<p> Prevention: balanced in calcium and phosphorus diet, in which meat should not be more than 33-40% of the daily diet, 500 mg of calcium per 1 kg of animal weight per day. It is better to use commercial feed, high quality - containing a full range of mineral and vitamin supplements. </p>
