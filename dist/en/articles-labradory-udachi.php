	<p>The dog breeder is a job for dedicated people. In order to decide to become them, you need to give up a lot. <br> Question - in the name of what? In the name of victories at exhibitions? In the name of charming puppies? In the name of numerous dogs, who take away the last time and energy, but because of their favorite every day more and more ... <br> I think that if you give up something in the name of someone, it is only for good luck, caught by the tail. Even if it is the tail of a Labrador. Among the breeders, outright "lucky ones" are a rarity. From the very beginning, their career develops successfully in all respects. Whether due to a subtle intuition, a balanced and reasonable approach or simple luck. Be that as it may, they have become successful, they are equal to them, they envy them. For a long time, I will, willy-nilly, observe the nursery of labradors "Timantti Solid." It is impossible to say that this breed was close to me, since in the presence of my own Golden, in my heart I am a “terrier”. But something always attracted me in this cattery. I think the extraordinary personality of his owner Tatyana Dreyer is a breeder not only with his name, experience and experience, but also an FCI expert, and one of the best, in my understanding. I like balanced and sensible breeders who do not climb on the rampage, do not tear the shirt on his chest, trying to prove something to someone, but calmly and purposefully, like powerful dreadnoughts, go to their goal and achieve it calmly and without too much pathos. And failures such breeders perceive without hysteria and tragedy, with philosophical calm. So maybe it is from such breeders to learn something? Perhaps their luck magically teleports to others and the world of dog breeding replenished with new "lucky"?...</p>

<p> <span class = "terra"> Tatiana Alexandrovna Dreyer </ span> is an excellent specialist and expert in Labradors, Vice President of the National Breed Club, expert of the RKF-FCI of international level, owner of the Labradorov nursery "Timantti Solid". </p>

<p> <span class = "terra"> - Tell us a little about yourself. How long have you been doing dogs? </span> </p>
<p> In our family, almost always (with interruptions to global cataclysms) there were dogs and horses. And you know, in every decent family, sooner or later, individuals arise who, instead of engaging in science or business, suddenly become horsemen or dog lovers. So we did it: my mom's younger brother is a famous horseman, a stuntman, now a coach who has champions of Russia among his pupils. But I was dragged down by cynology, although I am a philologist by education. </p>
<p> <span class = "terra"> - How did your passion start? Your first dog? </span> </p>
<p> The first dog is a boxer, he was given when I was 6 years old. But, naturally, it was a dog of my parents, and he considered me a punishment of his life, suffered, defended ... And then there were a poodle, a Tibetan terrier, Moscow watchdogs. And only later I got a beautiful labradorsha Ida (<span class = "terrasl"> Playmaker's Cherry Pie </span>). I immediately fell in love with this breed and disappeared completely ... </p>
<p> <span class = "terra"> - Why did you choose this particular breed? </p>
<p> Labradors in my life arose almost by accident. I seriously "hurt" Moscow watchdogs, and when my younger dog tragically died - the 3rd generation of my breeding, I wanted to change everything and get a completely different dog - a small, smooth-haired companion, not a bodyguard. So there was a thought about the Labrador. There were already Labradors in Russia then, but I couldn’t find what I wanted, and my friend who was engaged in American Cockers brought me a Labrador from Finland. This was the beginning of our cattery. </p>
<p> <span class = "terra"> - Tell me, please, his story. </p>
<p> I can say that in breeding dogs, in addition to knowledge, calculation and intuition, you need the presence of a certain amount of luck. Our history, like the history of any other kennel, is determined by great dogs - we were lucky; we had them from the very beginning. Very different people helped us get them, but one thing united them all - they were sick of cynology, familiarity with these people and their help were my greatest luck. <span class = "terrasl"> Playmaker's Cherry Pie </span> (Ida) - the first Labrador in Russia - Interchampion, the first champion of NHL and this dog has 10 CACIBs. Her daughter is <span class = "terrasl"> Timantti Solid Playmaker's Tytar </span> (Tut) - Interchampion, mother of 7 interchampions. <span class = "terrasl"> Porto Lab of Francos Valley </span> (Larry) - Inter and Multichampion - the son of the legendary double world and European champion, the father of an infinite number of champions in five countries. Son Tuty and Larry - <span class = "terrasl"> Timantti Solid Davidson </span> - Inter and Multichampion, three-time Eurasian Champion, spent a year in the UK. There he received 10 litters. His son <span class = "terrasl"> Ramsayville Raise The Stakes </span> at 10.5 months won the RCC at the UK Labrador Club Championship. His other children are in nurseries "<span class =" terrasl "> Gallybob </span>", "<span class =" terrasl "> Allenie </span>", "<span class =" terrasl "> Sudeo </span> "," <span class = "terrasl"> Criclecreek </span> ". And now we have five English males. One of them - Shaw, the champion of England, came to us for a while “to exchange tribal experience,” so to speak. This is the first case in the Russian history of Labradors, when a manufacturer of this level and with such titles is in Russia. These are the visible tip of the iceberg, called "the work of the nursery for 13 years." In fact, every litter, every dog is significant and we love, and it always seems that the next litter will be the best. And it is in him that the very ideal dog that every breeder dreams of will be born. </p>
<p> <span class = "terra"> - How many dogs live now and how many labradors do you find best in a kennel? </p>
<p> 21 dog. For a nursery, Labradors are a lot. Our dogs live in three houses, more precisely: in 2 houses and an apartment. I never did a nursery by myself. I consider my main talent and happiness that I manage to infect with my passion wonderful people who become close friends and help me in everything. Alone in the nursery labradors in our conditions can not cope. Sometimes people get tired of this endless marathon and move away from breeding dogs, but remain our friends. In decent nurseries, Labradors are neither in cages nor in cages. They must live near the person and communicate with him, otherwise they will be unhappy and inferior. In most European kennels lives 6-10 dogs. But there is such an incurable disease - “cynological greed”, when you want to leave it and that, and that ... </p>
<p> <span class = "terra"> - What qualities of breeders do you value most? </p>
<p> Lack of “nursery blindness”, interest in the breed, lack of composure, honesty - at least in relation to himself, ability to behave ... We have a fashionable breed, many problems ... </p>
<p> <span class = "terra"> - Do you have assistants in the nursery? </p>
<p> Globally - yes, now we have a younger generation of owners of our dogs who are very helpful, everyone who knows how. This and beautiful photos, and support for exhibitions. In the usual household sense, too. We now have a period of extraordinary luck: we found a wonderful young woman who works in a kennel, helps to mess with puppies, stays with dogs when I leave. </p>
<p> <span class = "terra"> - What does the name of your cattery mean? </p>
<p> The first dogs were Finnish - hence the name "Timantti" in Finnish called a diamond. “Timanty Solid” is an absolute, true diamond. </p>
<p> <span class = "terra"> - How do you feel about work tests? </p>
<p> It is ambiguous, there is something to work on. </p>
<p> <span class = "terra"> - Are you an experienced expert and often judge not only in Russia, what can you say about the current state of Labradors in Russia and abroad? </p>
<p> For me, this was said by many English experts who come to judge us annually. In Russia, one of the best flocks of Labradors, if not the best. It affects a variety of types, but their quality is very high. And we have the best handlers. This year I judged in France and the impression was twofold. On the one hand, it’s great when a breeder can show his dogs himself. It seems to be the end of his work: “he invented — gave birth — raised — showed — he won,” as British breeders work. All expose their dogs themselves, do not run fast and do not strain at all. But on the other hand, of course, the exterior of the dog, which still needs to be watched in motion, is also greatly lost. Not at insane speeds, but on a flat, slow trot. Therefore, their exhibitions are less spectacular. </p>
<p> <span class = "terra"> - What mistakes do breeders most often make? </p>
<p> Breeders' mistakes, unfortunately, are always fatal, we should not forget that the successful or unsuccessful embodiment of our ideas is the health of the dog and very often the happiness or sorrow of the family of its owners. According to my observations, oddly enough, a common mistake of a breeder is an underestimation of his type of dogs. Often happens - you judge in some city and you derive pleasure. It turns out 4-5 bitches of the same type in different classes, when you later find out that this is one cattery - you envy a little bit: you have a type, there are basic bitches, then you’ll have a little bit more ... and then it turns out that the breeder dreams on these, for example , fawn elegant bitches get heaviness and exaggeration, inherent in very different lines. He knits them with a foreign dog and loses his type, and to another, of course, does not come in one knitting ... </p>
<p> <span class = "terra"> - What kind of examination errors do you encounter most often? </p>
<p> The worst thing in judging Labradors is to judge them by projecting on them the features of another breed. Yes, in many breeds the standard is prescribed full-teeth. But Labrador is not in the standard. And you can’t say: “And I think that a Labrador should be full-toothed (thin, tall-legged, short-haired, with a short muzzle, etc.).” </p>
<p> For some reason, we forget that the CAC is not only a “candidate for champions” - the correct translation of this abbreviation is “Certificate of Conformity to the Standard” and you should not judge the general anatomy or your understanding of abstract beauty, but how close the dog is to ideal, which is described in the standard. Of course, the problem is that, as Professor R.Trike said, he chaired the FCI Standards Commission for many years: “All standards are divided into English ... and all others. You can change the appearance of the breed several times without changing the English standard. ” The FCI adopts the standard of the country of origin of the breed, i.e. speaking "English", we mean officially adopted and for all mandatory standard FCI. The English standard is rather laconic and democratic, it offers, for example, “ideal growth” and does not prescribe any sanctions for exceeding it, as it happens in the German standard. Guided by the English standard, the judge cannot enter the ring with a roster and, based on the results of measurements, downgrade to “good” or declare “disqualification”. Then why judges and not only ours, but also from those countries where there are almost no Labradors, allow themselves to consider teeth as Labradors or measure the length of the tail? No, and there were no such figures and indications in the standard! The situation is complicated by the fact that most of the famous labradorist-rock breeds are satisfied by judging only their favorite breed. They are not as widely popular and invited as, for example, “terrier” judges. All the more reason to invite them to monobreed shows and drive their dogs to these shows in order to learn the opinion of specialists. I’ll make a reservation that I’ve been struggling with “dentists” all my life, although my own dogs are full-toothed. Just, unfortunately, often such judges do not see anything except the jaws ... </p>
<p> <span class = "terra"> - What do you think about the concept of "type" in the Labrador breed? </p>
<p> The concept of "type" has become very fashionable and widespread, thanks to numerous forums, where this concept is often used to demonstrate its awareness. Finnish, English, Portuguese Labrador types are walking on the Internet ... For me, it remains a mystery ... The English-type Labrador is a fawn recognizable manufacturer <span class = "terrasl"> Rocheby Old Smokey </span> or the winner of this year's Crufts chocolate <span class = "terrasl"> Naiken Way out West </span>? And the Scandinavian type is an elegant fawn perfectly moving world champion of 2008 <span class = "terrasl"> Smart Fellow Saved By The Bell </span> or brown heavy rack-dogs of Mallorn’s kennel? There is one breed type of Labrador, for which the head and soft expression of the eyes and muzzle, a curved rib and a broad chest, double wool and otter tail are decisive. There are recognizable types created by different nurseries: for the nursery "<span class =" terrasl "> Sandylands </span>" were characterized by extraordinary head beauty, for "<span class =" terrasl "> Mardas </span>" - a little bit "Late", very clean lines, elegant as a true classic, dogs. And if there is more than one nursery in the country, then it’s already difficult to determine the national type of Labrador ... </p>
<p> <span class = "terra"> - Tell me about Labrador colors - which one is preferable for you and why? </p>
<p> As an owner and breeder, I love fawn dogs. But this love does not always determine the results of my judging. If I have a cool fawn dog in the ring, I’ll be happy to put it first. But if I have to choose from two medium-sized dogs, I would rather choose a black or brown one, simply because I know about pale-yellows how beautiful they can be and the requirements for them are slightly higher. And this is not only my position. In December, Mary McCulloch, an old Scottish breeder, judged at the Bomond specialized exhibition. After the exhibition, everyone excitedly discussed that, they say, the amateur of fawn dogs again tried, therefore they won only fawn. In fact, Mary has been breeding black dogs for many years and is fanatically devoted to this color. Well, she didn’t find her ideal black Labrador among the exhibited dogs. And there are many such examples ... </p>
<p> <span class = "terra"> - How do you feel about co-ownership? </p>
<p> Wary. Co-owners should treat each other incredibly scrupulous and try to give each other a little bit earlier than they are asked to do. Cases of successful condominiums are as rare as ideal marriages. </p>
<p> <span class = "terra"> - By what principle do you choose manufacturers? </p>
<p> I am a fanatical "boughs mom" and I think that in the breed everything is determined by the quality of the boughs, therefore, males for them should be chosen based on their strengths and weaknesses. The desire to be the first to run and tie his bitch to a famous dog is generally characteristic of beginning breeders. An experienced breeder will better wait and see what this dog gives. Of course, in our situation it is very difficult, we are terribly far from Europe, with the possible exception of maybe 6-7 people who constantly travel, watch and communicate. The rest are forced to choose the lines and the producers by the pictures ... If you talk to European breeders, they talk about "great and famous", like we did about our Moscow dogs: they saw them, walked with them in the same ring, won and lost. They know who is very big, and who is “under the knee” tall, and what other puppies have appeared at one or another producer, not considering his super famous descendants ... We brought to Russia for a while Sudeo Chevalier of Ramsayville not because he is the champion of England, but because we already had a litter from him, obtained from artificial insemination. And because while Davidson was in rent in Scotland, everyone was convinced that these lines fit very well: Chevy does not pass on to its descendants its exaggerated appearance. But his puppies inherit a beautiful skeleton and corners of the limbs. In any case, in combination with our lines. Five years ago I interviewed Lyudmila Moon. She then said: “Do not forget about old males and lines, sometimes it is better to return to them”, but to understand this thesis, everyone should walk by himself, passing his way ... If you go forward all the time without looking back, there is a chance to leave many good luck ... </p>
<p> <span class = "terra"> - What is most important for you - the exhibition or breeding? How often do you show your dogs? </p>
<p> I am not a gambling person and do not like the nervous atmosphere of our exhibitions. By the way, there is little in Europe where the atmosphere at exhibitions is so tense. There, people still try to communicate at shows, show dogs to each other, and not just win at any cost. For me, the main thing is breeding, when we have no litters for a long time, I begin to yearn. But, fortunately, I have gambling sports friends who like exhibitions. We export our dogs to 2-3 large Moscow shows, to specialized mono-breed under interesting experts, and abroad for new impressions and, to be honest, hoping to get new titles. I really like the rating system in France. There, breeders have an incentive to travel to almost all exhibitions, because the rating is considered in each breed separately and only by results within the country. Therefore, you have a real chance not to remain 125th in the list in the general list, but to sound in your breed. For this, in my opinion, it is worth fighting ... </p>
<p> <span class = "terra"> - What were the most significant results for you in the last year (or in the entire kennel history)? </p>
<p> It seems to me that in Russia the most significant results are always victories at the international and largest exhibition “Eurasia”. Such happiness came to us many times, but always remained the main joy. In 2009, the title “Best bitch” in Eurasia-2 won <span class = "terrasl"> Timantti Solid Presentation </span> - the daughter of Chevy, and on the maternal line the 4th generation of our breeding. The biggest success is the victory of our English solar boy - <span class = "terrasl"> Sudeo Elvis </span>, who became the Best of the breed at the Specialty World Dog Show in 2009 in Bratislava. He also won the Junior Class for Specialty in Budapest in 2008. The event for Moscow labradorists and, of course, for us was the title of the Best Dog of the Show, received by <span class = "terrasl"> Timantti Solid Davidson </span> at the RRB show in autumn 2009. </p>
<p> <span class = "terra"> - How often do you have litters? </p>
<p> From my own bitches, 2–3 litters per year, plus usually 2–3 litters from our bitches co-owned. </p>
<p> <span class = "terra"> - At what age do you sell puppies? </p>
<p> Basically, 2 months. </p>
<p> <span class = "terra"> - What is the portrait of the ideal owner of a Labrador? </p>
<p> A middle-aged family, when children are already grown up, and grandchildren are not yet, with a cottage and a burden to nature. </p>
<p> <span class = "terra"> - What is the social status of a Labrador buyer? </p>
<p> The Labrador is still a dog for the middle class, it requires daily communication with its beloved master, so even the great rich and famous owner is worse for the Labrador than a normal average family. </p>
