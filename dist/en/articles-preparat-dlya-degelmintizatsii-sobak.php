<p style="text-transform:uppercase; color:#993300;">Milbemaks prevents such a dangerous disease as dirofilariasis (heartworms) by destroying the larvae, microfilariae, in the bloodstream, preventing their development into adult form. </p>
<p> Puppies can be dewormed by Milbemaks from 2 weeks of age and weighing 0.5 kg. </p>
<p> If a dog or puppy weighs from 0.5 to 1 kg, give 1/2 tablets, and animals from 1 kg to 5 kg a whole tablet. </p>
<p> For dogs of medium and large breeds, there are other tablets, larger ones. </p>
<p> For a dog weighing from 5 to 25 kg we give 1 tablet, for dogs from 25 to 50 kg 2 tablets. </p>
<p> As for cats that are very difficult to give any medicine, there is a convenient pill, small and coated, which additionally contributes to easy ingestion and the absence of such unpleasant consequences as increased drooling. For a cat weighing 2 to 4 kg, only 1/2 of a tablet is required, for an animal weighing from 4 to 8 kg - 1 tablet. Kittens can be given the drug from 6 weeks of age and upon reaching a mass of 0.5 kg, but for such babies there is a separate dosage, which will soon be available. As for pregnant and lactating animals, the use of Milbemaks is possible in the last trimester of pregnancy and 2 to 3 weeks after birth, which is important because infection of puppies and kittens occurs during pregnancy and through mother’s milk. </p>
<p> All the animals in the family should undergo de-worming at the same time, and also remember to treat your pets for fleas, since they are carriers of tapeworms. Before giving a medicine to cock an animal, the effectiveness of any drug depends on the accuracy of the dosage. </p>
<p> Milbemaks is better to use in the morning feeding with a small amount of food or give force to the root of the tongue after taking the feed. For therapeutic purposes, the drug is given once, for prophylactic purposes once every three months, in a therapeutic dose. To prevent infection of animals with heartworms, Milbemaks is recommended to be given once a month, during the summer of mosquitoes. In a family where there are young children who communicate closely with pets, it is desirable to de-worming animals once a month, as a preventive measure. With Milbemaks, de-worming is easy, convenient and effective. </p>
