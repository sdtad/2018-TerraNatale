	<p>You have acquired a puppy and a true friend and how it will grow now depends on you and on your respect for the dog. Remember that the first year of life is the most important stage in the development of the organism and the character of the dog. <br> You are the owners of the puppy from the moment of purchase. Accordingly, only you make all the decisions on his fate. The advice of the others, including our advice, is advisory. However, try to listen to them, as these tips are based on many years of experience of dog handlers and recommendations of veterinarians. Before you go to pick up a puppy, you must prepare for his appearance in your home. Choose a place to sleep and feed him. The puppy will need toys, bowls, a leash with a collar. A first-aid medical kit and more are also needed...</p>

<p> You brought a puppy to the house. Not just a dog enters your home, but a rational creature, a friend, a companion, a new family member — enters, bringing joy, care, friendship and unlimited devotion. The appearance of a puppy in the house is a very important event. Now all your efforts should be directed to its proper cultivation and maintenance. </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold;"> It is important to learn how to properly pick a puppy in your hands. </p>
<p> To raise a puppy, take it with your right hand under the chest, and your left hand under the ass, or from both sides, grabbing the chest and shoulder area, but in any case not by the front paws and not under the belly. </p>
<center><img src="<?php print $siteurleng;?>img/articles/articles3-1.jpg"></center>
<p> Hold tightly so that the puppy does not break loose and fall to the floor. Do not lift or pull the puppy by the paws; you can easily dislocate the joints, earn a sprain or damage the ligaments. Do not allow children to carry a puppy in their arms, as there is a high probability that they will fall and be injured. Since the puppies are very nimble and nimble, children can not always keep them and prevent falling. Better to play with the puppy on the floor. Never leave a puppy unattended on a couch, chair, etc., it can also unsuccessfully jump and get injured. </p>
<p> If your apartment has a tiled floor, laminate or parquet, we strongly recommend covering the floor with carpeted floors or paths - so that the puppy can move around without the risk of damaging the ligaments, and also that the legs do not disperse.</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold; color:#993300;">SAFETY IN THE HOUSE</p>
<p> Since the puppy is also a child, but only a dog, he wants to learn about the world around him, that is, to try everything for a tooth (he has no other way). </p>
<p> 1. Remove all small, sharp and fragile objects, toothpicks, needles, pins, paper clips, buttons, nails - a puppy can swallow them. </p>
<p> 2. All drugs, laundry detergents, detergents, scouring pads, any drugs with added chemicals (including shoe polish and fountain pens and felt-tip pens) should be out of reach of your puppy. </p>
<p> 3. You should remove the flower pots, because the puppies will easily dig up and try the soil and the plant, and this can lead to intestinal inflammation or poisoning. </p>
<p> 4. Plastic things that can be chewed and swallow - rubber children's toys (they are not designed for the child to gnaw + tweeters at them), plastic stoppers, covers, parts from children's designers, stolen ballpoint pens, etc. Such things are dangerous not only by intestinal blockage, but also by poisoning by dyes added to plastic. All that you can tear off the chips and swallow them - a mop handle, a broom, a dustpan - should be kept out of the reach of the puppy. </p>
<p> 5. It is necessary to close the telephone and electrical wires, extension cords, etc. in advance. Any wires, even well-insulated, can be cut through. If they are not energized - swallow braid and insulation. </p>
<p> Remove mobile and radio telephones, cameras, TV remote control, glasses and other valuables higher. </p>
<p> 6. NEVER allow children to sit on or ride a puppy. This is not a horse. You should not allow a puppy to crawl under low furniture - this can lead to curvature of the limbs or spine. </p>
<p> 7. Do not allow your puppy to jump off the couch - it can damage the ligaments. </p>
<p> 8. Up to 5 months down the puppy to carry only on the elevator or demolished in his arms. He can climb upstairs on his own (but without fanaticism, he should start gradually, until he is above the third). </p>
<p> 9. Do not allow your puppy to bite your hands, even while playing. Take your hand and say: "It is impossible!". </p>
<p> 10. Do not allow children (and do not do it yourself!) To stroke the puppy on the head - this spoils the formation of the correct position of the ears. You can iron the neck, back, without touching the head at all, or on the back of the head. </p>
<p> 11. Do not play "pulling" with a puppy - rags, ropes, toys. Don't let rags, bones, toys take care of yourself - your teeth are not yet strong, you can spoil the baby's bite and create digestive problems. </p>
<p> 12. Do not yell at the puppy! The surest way to make a neurotic from a dog is to shout loudly at it for wrongdoing or throw objects at all. If you want to punish her, take her by the scruff of the neck and just shake it. </p>
<p> 13. Trash can should be out of reach of a puppy. The puppy does not know that it’s not good to eat what lies in the garbage can, and there may be harmful products for the puppy in the garbage. </p>
<p> 14. It is categorically unacceptable that the puppy is walking down the street until all vaccinations are delivered! Even one time may be enough to make the puppy sick! Also, before vaccination, do not allow the puppy to have access to outdoor shoes, sniffed and licked it. </p>
<p> 15. Well, in order to protect yourself, keep mink coats, leather shoes and other valuable and favorite things away, so as not to be offended by the puppy later. </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold; color: #993300;"> FEEDING </p>
<p> The puppy should have a specific feeding place. It must be constant. </p>
<p> It is necessary to buy two bowls - for food and for water from stainless steel with a rubber rim on the bottom, so that the puppy does not chase this bowl throughout the kitchen. The optimum bowl volume is 1.8 to 2 liters, or a two-bowl rack made of stainless steel and adjustable in height. The height of the stand is increased as the puppy grows (the upper edge is at chest level). The stand does not allow the baby to get all four paws into the bowl and contributes to the formation of good posture. </p>
<center><img src="<?php print $siteurleng;?>img/articles/articles3-2.jpg"></center>
<p> 1. The first 5 days of feeding the baby with the same food as he used to eat at the breeder (in order to avoid indigestion). </p>
<p> 2. If you decide to change the diet, do it gradually. Carefully watch the puppy's feces. </p>
<p> Do not forget at the same time that if you decide to leave with feeding with dry feed and switch to natural food, you must provide certain vitamins, mineral supplements without fail. Consult your breeder. </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold; color: #993300;"> CHOOSE FEED. </p>
<p> How to feed a puppy? This difficult question arises before each owner. Someone chooses feeding with natural products, someone decides to feed the puppy with ready-made feeds, others choose a mixed feeding mode. Each of these methods has strong supporters and equally convinced opponents, so we do not dare to make recommendations on the choice of one of them. </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold; color: #993300;"> FEEDING DRY FEED </p>
<p> DRY FEED SUPER PREMIUM CLASS or PREMIUM CLASS - it is convenient, simple, without unnecessary trouble and justifies itself in monetary terms. In this case, the puppy gets all the necessary vitamins, minerals, properly grows and develops. We recommend soaking food for single meals - pour dry food with boiled or sheltered slightly warm water per 100 g of dry food - 300-350 g of water. </p>
<p> Food will soak in about 1 -2 hours. As the dry food starts to turn sour quickly, be sure to soak in a new portion of the feed before each feeding. Soaked feed must be fed for at least three months. The daily rate of not soaked feed is indicated on the package with feed. The norm must be chosen according to the table based on the puppy's age and current puppy weight. This amount is divided by the number of feedings, and you get a one-time feed rate. A puppy's tummy after a meal is filled, but the baby should not turn into a keg. Before the next feeding, the tummy should fall off noticeably, although not “stick to the back”. Clean water should always be in a place accessible to the puppy! </p>
<center> <img src = "img/articles/articles3-3.jpg"> </center>
<p> You can add a little 1% kefir or natural yogurt to the soaked food. Feeding should be distributed so as not to overload the puppy's stomach at a time. </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold; color: #993300;"> FEEDING NATURAL FOOD </p>
<p> When feeding with a naturalka, the main thing is to observe the correct proportions of proteins, fats, carbohydrates! All products are introduced into the puppy's diet gradually, no more than one new product per WEEK! </p>
<p> MEAT OF BEEF, CELEATIN - 50% (flank of the fat is a thin layer of muscle tissue, which is a shell of the abdominal cavity of the cow, ate to eat fat to remove, or meat from the leg (chicken drumstick). Pre-freeze the raw meat for at least 48 hours. Scar not peeled not more than 100 grams per day (2-3 times a week). Beef can be replaced with rabbit or turkey meat. </p>
<p> GRUP 30% - rice or buckwheat. Cooking like that. Fill with water about two fingers on top of the cereal. Boil, boil for 10 minutes, turn off, cover with a warm thing and let walk about two hours. </p>
<p> VEGETABLES 20% - vegetables are best extinguished (carrots, broccoli, zucchini, pumpkin) raw can be given to gnaw an apple. Orange vegetables can cause allergies, so everything is given gradually, little by little. In the summer it is useful to add fresh greens, green salad. </p>
<p style="font-weight:bold; color:#993300;">DAIRY PRODUCTS</p>
<p> Cottage cheese (non-fat), kefir (1%), whey, natural yogurt (without additives and dyes). </p>
<p> When the rice is hot add chopped meat and vegetables. Meat cut into small pieces (mince is better not to give: he does not have time to digest in the stomach), pre-pour boiling water or boil for five minutes. Puppies in the period of growth of 20-30 grams of meat per kilogram of dog weight, adult dogs - 10-15 grams per kg of weight. </p>
<p> In the morning for the first feeding you can give 1% cottage cheese with 1% yogurt - about 150 grams. Twice a week, you can add one quail egg or 1 egg of yolk to cottage cheese or meat. From 3 to 4 months we feed 4 times a day. From 4 months three times a day. One serving is approximately 200 grams or one glass, individually for each puppy you can slightly increase or decrease the serving! In the evening feeding, meat should be given without porridge, but only with steamed vegetables (carrots, zucchini). </p>
<p> As fats, 1 teaspoon of olive oil (cold pressed) or 1 teaspoon of flaxseed oil is best for the dog. Twice a week, replace meat with fish, only from 4 months! We recommend giving only marine fish - cod, hake, ice and blue whiting. </p>
<p> Preparation - clean the fish, rinse well, remove tough fins, ridge, large bones and head, cut into pieces, boil slightly, cool and pour with sunflower or olive oil. Fish need to be given twice as much as meat because of the low protein content. </p>
<p> It is useful for strengthening the ligaments and joints of the dog to cook aspic. Cook better in a pressure cooker, as a very long time :). Jelly is a wonderful thing and very useful for the dog, especially for the growing one, as a source of natural gelatin and other useful substances. Cooking jelly is very simple, you need a large pan, a pair of calf or beef legs, beef tail and 5-6 hours of time. My "legs" and "tail", pour water and cook for a long time on low heat so that the broth does not boil off completely. When everything is ready, take out the legs and tail, remove from them and cut everything that can be torn off, including the veins and cartilage. The resulting jelly, cool, put in the refrigerator and add every day for 2 tablespoons in the food. Dogs just adore it. </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold; color: #993300; text-align: center;"> Attention! NEVER give bones to your dog after cooking aspic, boiled bones can easily traumatize the internal organs of your dog. Provided the puppy is fed natural products, every day until one year old, the puppy should receive a complex of vitamins and minerals. </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold; color: #993300;"> Vitamins and Minerals </p>
<p> KANINA Velpenkalk is a complex mineral supplement for puppies designed specifically for a growing body, ensuring optimal skeletal and dental system development. </p>
<p> KANINA V25 - Vitamin complex for puppies and dogs - the vitamins contained in the V25 feed supplement provide normal growth, hematopoietic functions, protein and fat metabolism, a healthy nervous system. If the puppy gets at least half the diet in the form of high-quality (super-premium) dry puppy food, mineral supplements are not recommended. </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold; color: #993300; text-align: center;"> OVERDOSE OF VITAMINS CAN BE PROVID MUCH MORE DANGEROUS THAN THEIR DEDICTION! </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold; color: #993300;"> MIXED FEEDING </p>
<p> The main thing to be observed is that at least 5 hours should pass between the feed and the meat. Meat should always be given only for the night, after the evening walk! If you feed feed, it is better to refuse porridge! And we must remember that when feeding ready-made feeds, the dog’s meat is given only so that the stomach knows its live food and can digest it, that is, a small portion is given and not more than three times a week! For a puppy of 3 months it is no more than 150 grams, for an adult dog no more than 400 grams! Dry food is already balanced and very calorie, so the excess can cause all sorts of metabolic disorders, excess protein, etc. When mixed feeding can be given along with the meat steamed vegetables. As a treat apple, a puppy is not more than a quarter a day (peeled). The volume of feed is selected individually, based on the age and type of feeding the puppy. A single volume should be such that after a meal, the puppy's tummy slightly rounded, but does not swell like a ball. </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold; color: #993300;"> THAN YOU CAN NOT FEED! </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold; color: #993300;"> - Hot (straight from the plate) cold, spicy, salty, fatty, sweet, smoked food; </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold; color: #993300;"> - You can’t give bones instead of food, they are not digested, they can cause constipation, perforation of the intestine, twisting of intestines. The tubular bones, which tend to split into sharp parts, are especially dangerous. Bones also contribute to teeth grinding; </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold; color: #993300;"> - You cannot feed pork and fat mutton; </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold; color: #993300;"> - Do not give flour products and pastries (pasta, cereals, cookies, pastries, etc.); </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold; color: #993300;"> - Sausages for dogs - poison. The dog should not know what sausages, sausage, ham. They spoil the liver, and the dog risks to die already at a young age. </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold; color: #993300;"> - You can not give sugar, chocolate, candy. Sweets violate digestion. In addition, they destroy the teeth and extremely adversely affect the eyes, which begin to water; </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold; color: #993300;"> - You can not feed human food (soup, cereal, burgers, fried and stewed), as well as its remnants; </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold; color: #993300;"> - You should not add spices to your dog's food: pepper, bay leaf, spicy tomato sauce; </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold; color: #993300;"> - Feed rotten and sour foods. </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold; color: #993300;"> PUPPET'S PLACE FOR SLEEP AND REST </p>
<p> According to the retrievers, the best place is where the owner is. Do not be surprised if your retriever will constantly move with you from room to room, even if a minute before that he slept deeply. Nevertheless, the dog must have its place in the house, where it can remain alone and you should respect its right to privacy and not be disturbed when it is in its shelter. When choosing and arranging a place for a puppy, remember that a large enough dog will grow out of it and you need to have enough space to lie with your legs extended. </p>
<p> Place a puppy, and an adult dog, you need to organize in a comfortable corner: not on the aisle, not near the battery and not at the door (entrance, balcony), preferably away from those places where he often walk, where he can rest and he will not be disturbed. Wicker baskets, as well as beautiful stove benches, look beautiful, but the puppy will quickly crack the basket on separate twigs and their parts once in the puppy's body, can damage it. Until the baby understands that you do not need to eat what you are sleeping on, a bed can be a mattress, a rug, and a pillowcase on top. For convenience, it is recommended to have several removable pillow cases on the litter, periodically change them and wash them. Never punish a dog in its place! The dog must always feel that it is in this place that it is safe. </p>
<p> A puppy needs to buy different toys - special rubber bones, rubber molded balls (which cannot be cracked), bones from the veins, so that he can practice, have fun and be distracted from chewing your things. Hollow rubber, plastic, soft toys can be chipped, and the puppy can choke on their pieces or swallow them and then suffer from stomach pain. For this reason, you should always carefully observe how the puppy nibbles the toy, and at the first sign of damage, replace it with a new one. In addition, from time to time you can give your puppy special gut-bone treats. They are made in such a way that they dissolve in saliva and do not form sharp fragments. </p>
<h2> Preventive measures </2>
<p style = "font-weight: bold; color: #993300;"> Prevention of parasitic diseases. </p>
<p> Helminths, or intestinal parasites, worms. The breeder should supply you with the following information: </p>
<p> * When was the prevention of worms, what drug and when to repeat the procedure; </p>
<p> * When and which vaccine was given, with which drug, and when the next vaccine should be given. </p>
<p> One of the most common mistakes is vaccination of a dog that has not previously been rid of worms. The presence of worms in their action is a disease: toxins secreted by them inhibit the immune system and it can not produce antibodies in sufficient quantities. Therefore, do not forget 7-10 days before the vaccination, it is necessary to give a dog anthelmintic drugs! </p>
<p> It is possible to vaccinate a dog only in a veterinary clinic or call a doctor at home! Before vaccination, the puppy should look completely healthy and feel good. After vaccination, it is advisable to observe the puppy for 5-6 hours, and if signs of an allergic reaction appear, such as swelling of the nasopharynx, difficulty breathing, hardening of the lips, call the doctor immediately. Allergic reactions to vaccination are very rare, but, unfortunately, there are. Try not to combine for several days before the vaccination and after it the treatment of fleas and ticks. </p>
<p> We recommend using the Nobivac vaccine. </p>
<p> The following vaccinations are mandatory: the first is at 2 months, the second is in 3-4 weeks. A rabies vaccination can be given along with a comprehensive second vaccination, or after changing teeth in 6-7 months. Next, the dog should be vaccinated annually from parvovirosis plague, leptospirosis, etc. and rabies. Remember that before vaccination you should definitely get rid of worms. If, as a result of this treatment, it is found that the dog was glued, then the treatment should be repeated and the dog should be vaccinated only after consulting a veterinarian. </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold; color: #993300;"> PROCESSING AGAINST GLISTS </p>
<p> Chase away worms every three to four months. Accurately follow the dosage, which is indicated in the instructions. Weigh the dog and calculate the dosage. Overdose can lead to serious complications, including the death of an animal, and insufficient dosage does not cure parasites. In cases of severe coarseness, it is necessary to repeat deworming after 10 days. If several animals live in your house, then hold similar events at the same time for everyone to avoid the danger of reinfection of worms from each other. </p>
<p> We recommend using antihelminics - Pratel (Pratel) </p>
<p> Pratel (Pratel) is a broad-spectrum anthelmintic drug containing pyrantel embonate and praziquantel as active ingredients. </p>
 <center><img src="<?php print $siteurleng;?>img/articles/articles3-4.jpg"></center>
<p> The deworming of puppies with Pratel (Pratel) is performed from 30 days of age. With the preventive purpose deworming is recommended to be carried out quarterly. The drug animals give once in the above doses. </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold; color: #993300;"> HANDLING AGAINST TICK AND FLEED </p>
<p> Ticks and fleas can be carriers of various diseases. One of the most dangerous diseases carried by ticks is piroplasmosis. In case of untimely provision of a dog with veterinary care, the death of your pet may occur on the 3rd day of illness. We recommend Advantiks drops or spray or Front Line drops. In winter, treatment should be carried out once every 2 months, from spring to autumn - once every three weeks. In the summer, you can use 1.5 doses once a month. The dose is calculated based on the weight of the dog. Please note that the drug should be applied to the skin of the animal, and not on the coat. A few days before and after treatment the dog should not be bathed. </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold; color: #993300;"> HYGIENE </p>
<p> Keep your litter clean. For convenience, it is recommended to have several removable pillow cases on the litter, periodically change them and wash them. After the walk, wipe the paws and, if necessary, belly with a damp cloth or wash with clean water without soap, if it is dirty on the street. Wash with shampoo puppy without special need should not be, only in case of heavy pollution. After bathing with ordinary shampoo, the puppy should be protected from drafts. Ears should be cleaned with a cotton swab with petroleum jelly or a special ear lotion. The ear lotion helps to dissolve the earwax and pushes it out, where it is convenient to clean it with a tampon. </p> 
<center><img src="<?php print $siteurleng;?>img/articles/articles3-5.jpg"></center>
<p> Periodically shear the claws of the puppy (curving tip) with special clappers. The fifth finger will always have to be cut, despite the fact that the dog grinds off the rest of the claws on the asphalt while walking. </p>
<p style = "color: #993300;"> ATTENTION! It is necessary to cut the claws very carefully so as not to cut off the excess and do not touch the vessel! If you hit a living tissue and blood, it is URGENTLY necessary to treat the wound with dry potassium permanganate - its crystals, taken on a cotton swab, press the cut. </p>
<p> Carefully monitor the condition of your baby’s teeth, especially during their shift. If milk teeth interfere with the growth of permanent, problems with bite and puppy canines are possible. In the event that milk teeth do not fall out independently, it is necessary to contact a veterinarian. Never pull toys out of your mouth, do not allow playing with a leash on the street. When your puppy grows up, make sure that it does not form tartar, which will inevitably lead to diseases of the oral cavity. Allergy (red ears or dandruff) is possible to replace food or to an excess of vitamins. If your puppy "rides the pope" or tries to bite often under his tail, the reason for this, as a rule, is worms or inflammation of the anal glands. Ask the veterinarian to show you how to clean them, and in the future you will be able to carry out this procedure yourself. </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold; color: #993300;"> TEACHING TO THE TOILET </p>
<p> After sleeping and playing, the puppy has a natural need - to empty the bladder and intestines, in this case it is good to take the puppy to the street (only after all vaccinations) or to the space reserved for the special diaper (we recommend baby disposable diapers - they sold in any supermarket or pharmacy). Consciously puppies start asking from the age of 4 months, but much depends on the skills and patience of the owners, you can be accustomed to cleanliness before. As soon as you notice that the puppy begins to spin and sit down, you need to put him in a place prepared for these purposes and hold it a little. In most cases, the puppy quickly gets used to using these "home comforts. </p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold; color: #993300;"> puppy education issues </p>
<p> On the first night at a new place, your baby may whine a little, and, most likely, he will stubbornly scrape his paws and ask you to go to bed. Until now, his whole world was in the "nest" in which he was born, his mother, brothers, sisters - littermates were next to him, and all of a sudden everything changed. The puppy is in a state of mild stress. Be patient, do not take him to bed. </p>
<p> Do not allow from the first day of what the adult dog cannot do in the future. The dog does not understand - today it is possible, but tomorrow it is impossible. If you give a weakness, get ready for the fact that the new tenant will always share a bed with you! </p>
<p> The first command that is taught to the puppy is the "No" command. A puppy should know and execute this command well. </p>
<p> Already at a very early age, you can slowly teach your puppy to perform the command "To me!". </p>
<p> Encourage him to carry out this command both at home and on the street. As a reward there may be a piece of treat, a favorite toy, and most importantly, of course, do not skimp on the praise. Remember, if your baby has done something wrong, but nevertheless executed the command "To me" and ran up to you, in no case can you punish the puppy! After the execution of this command, all the "scores" for past faults must be forgotten. If this happens, your dog will never approach you on the street. If on walks to take a puppy on a leash only in order to lead home, he quickly learns that "To me!" due to the unpleasant termination of the walk. If it is possible to let go of the puppy to run without a leash, then it is necessary after he ran a little, take him on a leash, walk around with him, and then release him again. In one walk, this should be done several times, then there will be no problems with the leash. In addition to working out the team "Ko me!" These exercises will teach the dog to walk calmly on a leash. In modern cities a lot of dogs die under the wheels of cars. On crowded streets and driveways, a puppy and an adult dog (even a very obedient one) should only be on a leash. A small puppy, playing around, can encroach on your new shoes, left in the corridor, or on recently hung wallpaper, leave a puddle in an unwanted place, etc. Remember, you can stop unwanted actions with your voice, do not spank or otherwise punish the puppy. He responds very well to intonation and will understand that you are unhappy. </p>
<p> It's even better not to “provoke” a puppy. Leaving him alone at home, remove the small and necessary things that are available to his teeth, especially shoes, threads, needles, and so on. Raise curtains, hanging tablecloths, wires. </p>
<p> A puppy can not immediately assimilate numerous prohibitions. </p>
<p> Punishment for the "crime" can only be found on the site of the "crime" at the time of its commission. If you came home, and your favorite slippers were dismantled to the ground, the puppy jumps for joy when he sees you, and you start scolding him, he will decide what he got for such a stormy meeting, and he won't even remember the slippers. For a puddle or a bunch of punished in general can not be! It is only necessary to show that this is not good and that you are not satisfied (with voice, facial expressions). The metabolism of a growing puppy is so stormy that in an apartment he can soil up to 5-6 months. You will take out to the yard after each sleep, feeding - the pools will become significantly less. In the apartment, you can take a puppy to a specially designated place with a newspaper, rag, or a pharmacy sheet on the floor, laid on the floor. If you need to leave for a sufficiently long period, the puppy should be well "walk away" and feed, then most of the time before your arrival, he will sleep. </p>
<p style = "color: #993300;"> You cannot walk with an unvaccinated puppy! </p>
<p> Vaccination should be carried out before the change of teeth, that is, up to 3 months. Owners of puppies need to remember that lack of physical activity, as well as inadequate feeding at the age of 1.5 years, that is, during the period of intensive development, will not be able to compensate later, and a good breeding, working, show dog will not leave this puppy! The little puppy should walk often, but little by little - so as not to get tired. Gradually the number of walks decreases, and their duration increases. From 6 months puppy can walk for 20 minutes without a leash and half an hour on a leash daily or walk 4-5 km a day. Long walks can be made ONLY TO THE FOOD. Puppies should be brought as often as possible, but do not forget - long walks just before eating, after eating you can go only for the sake of keeping the house clean. If there is an opportunity, then it is necessary to give play with peers, but under your supervision, preventing dangerous moments.
