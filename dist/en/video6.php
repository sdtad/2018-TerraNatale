	<p>Massage dogs. A practical guide.</p>
	<p>If you are going to treat your pet with the help of massage, you, in addition to the basic knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the dog, you must master the massage technique. In this book, you will find everything you need to know with regards to movements during massage, pressing force, rhythm, techniques and consistency. Certain techniques are designed for appropriate states and conditions. You will learn about different areas of stress in working animals and areas where stress is most likely to occur. Massage is an amazing diagnostic tool. You will be able to feel muscle tension or swelling, and identify them much earlier than visually or with a routine examination. Massage will help to avoid the development of many complications that could later require expensive treatment of the animal.</p>

<p>Massage can be done to dogs of any breed, as it is no less important than trimming claws, eating or caring for your pet. Massage to dogs significantly improves their life, gives the dog the opportunity to feel that you love her and take care of her. </p>
<p>By doing a massage to a dog, you treat its muscles, ligaments and tendons. Massage is performed as prevention, treatment and rehabilitation after an illness. With the help of massage you can set in motion many processes in the dog. Most dogs love manual therapy, because everyone knows that dogs love to be stroked. </p>
<p>Massage is done after a complete picture of the state of the animal's muscles has been obtained, the location of various stresses and other “blockages” has been determined. For treatment, they use the methods of classical massage, massage of the connective tissue, therapy of the trigger point (these are painful muscle tissue thickening), stretching and mobilization. </p>
<p>How to massage your pet? </p>
<p>First of all, you should consult with a veterinarian, as severely ill dogs are not recommended to have a massage. </p>
