	<p><a href="<?php print $siteurleng;?>articles-kaltsiy-drug-ili-vrag.php">Calcium: friend or foe?</a></p>
	<p>Calcium is one of the main building elements in the body of both humans and animals. <br> It is responsible for blood clotting, muscle contraction, and the excitability of the nervous system. Many are worried about the lack of calcium in the body, but few people think about its excess, and this is important because with a lack of calcium, puppies can develop rickets, growth retardation, delayed tooth replacement, and with an excess - osteochondrosis, hypertrophic osteodystrophy, curvature of the radial bones and other diseases. Therefore, it is necessary to remember that there needs a middle ground.</p>

	<p>Three colors of Labrador are known: classic black, fawn (from light cream, almost white to brightly red - red-fox) and chocolate (from light brown to the color of dark chocolate). Labradors have the following rule of color inheritance: black color is dominant, and fawn and chocolate are recessive, that is, to get puppies of one of the recessive colors, both parents must be recessive, or one of the parents must have a recessive color, or both parents with different color, must carry the same recessive gene.</p>

In principle, if the owner is not possible due to time or health, “rytsit” with a dog on a leash around the microdistrict, it should be great. <br> But the question is - how correctly are they used? <br> And is it possible to use them for the good and without damage to health?</p>

	<p>Very often, we ask the question: “What kind of food is good?” <br> And in fact, the answer to it is incredibly simple: <br> The food that fits this particular dog is good. <br> And for each dog, it may be a completely different feed.</p>

	<p>The little puppy is so fond of his master, who replaced his mother, that he is ready to run up to him at his first call. But later, he stops doing it, and the reason for this, most often, are the owners themselves. A dog will eventually stop coming to your call if: A puppy has long grown into an adult dog, and you walk with him in the volume of a puppy. An adult dog needs more impressions and physical awards than a puppy. Experiencing informational and stressful “hunger”, she will only think about how to escape from you into the wild, where everything is “new and everything worries”.</p>

	<p>As you pick up a puppy from a mother, you become responsible for teaching him his daily life. During socialization, you gradually and carefully introduce your pet to things that are new and new to him, sounds, and different situations. Socialization is designed to help your dog successfully integrate not only into human society, but also into the society of animals around it.</p>
