	<p>If you are going to treat your pet with the help of massage, you, in addition to the basic knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the dog, you must master the massage technique. In this book, you will find everything you need to know with regards to movements during massage, pressing force, rhythm, techniques and consistency. Certain techniques are designed for appropriate states and conditions. You will learn about different areas of stress in working animals and areas where stress is most likely to occur. Massage is an amazing diagnostic tool. You will be able to feel muscle tension or swelling, and identify them much earlier than visually or with a routine examination. Massage will help to avoid the development of many complications that could later require expensive treatment of the animal.</p>
