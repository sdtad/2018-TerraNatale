<p> First, this is a GPS tracker, taking into account the distance traveled and the time spent walking. </p>
<p> That allows you not only to have a good time in the company of your four-legged friend, but also to plan the walk in terms of the training load for the dog. Secondly, the program will warn you in advance of approaching another user. </p>
<p> You, in turn, will be able to view the profile of the dog you are approaching. </p>
<p> It stores information about the animal's age, gender, and potential level of aggression. </p>
<p> Such an opportunity, you see, will help avoid collisions or, on the contrary, make new friends. </p>

<p> Thirdly, DogScanner allows you to share your routes on social networks, making it possible to organize mini-communities of interests for joint walks. </p>
<p> Fourthly, the map inside the application allows you to exchange information about potentially dangerous or, conversely, interesting places for walks, as well as about infrastructure facilities that provide services for dogs and their owners. </p>
<p> And in conclusion, if the dog is suddenly lost, you can give a distress signal and involve your friends in the search. </p>
