<p> Teeth cleaning in dogs is an important and necessary procedure for the health of the dog. It should be carried out regularly. </p>
<p> For dogs that are not prone to the formation of tartar, it is enough to brush their teeth once every 2 weeks. </p>
<p> Those who are prone to the formation of plaque and tartar, brushing should be carried out 1-2 times a week. </p>
<p> Puppies do not need to brush their teeth, because approximately up to 6-7 months, there is a change of primary teeth to primary ones. </p>
<p> But this does not mean that you should not monitor the condition of your pet's teeth. </p>
<p> It is necessary to regularly check the teeth and thereby gradually accustom the puppy to the procedure of brushing your teeth. </p>
<p> Teeth brushing should be associated with something pleasant in a puppy, so we’ll come up with a bit of a trick to this issue. </p>
<p> It is necessary to cook beef broth, without vegetables, without salt and generally without any additives. Meat cut into small pieces - it is also useful to us. Sit back in a chair, take a puppy in your arms, say the command "Teeth!" Loudly and clearly. and wipe the puppy's teeth with a piece of gauze (bandage) moistened in broth, wound on the index finger in circular motions. If the procedure goes smoothly, do not forget to praise the puppy "Well, well done!", And immediately encourage the puppy with a piece of meat. </p>
<p> Thus, we teach a puppy that all manipulations with his mouth are a pleasant pleasure, after which, of course, subject to obedient behavior, the baby will get a tidbit. If a puppy screams, resists, scratches, or bites even more, in no case can he be rewarded with a snack. With this you just fix this behavior of the baby. </p>
<p> Starting from 8-9 months, you can start brushing your teeth using special toothpastes. </p>

<p> The selection of toothpastes for dogs is not particularly wide. In pet stores most often are pasta companies of reputable care products and hygiene products for dogs, such as 8 in 1, Hartz, Beaphar, Trixie. </p>
<p> The main difference between toothpaste for dogs and human paste is the absence of foaming agents, fluoride and many other chemical elements. Dog pastes do not foam at all and, after application, do not require rinsing or rinsing the mouth with water. They are harmless even if swallowed. </p>
<p> You can not use toothpaste designed for people, because the dog will swallow it, and this can lead to problems with the stomach. Manufacturers produce pasta, specially designed for dogs. They can be flavored with the smell of beef, chicken or other dog smells. Canine toothpaste is not harmful to swallow. </p>
<p> You need to buy a special toothbrush for dogs. Human toothbrushes are not suitable because they are too large and do not fit well in the mouth of a dog. The ideal dog toothbrush should have a triangular head - for more thorough cleaning - and very soft bristles. </p>

<p style = "color: #993300; text-transform: uppercase;"> How often should I brush my teeth? </p>
<p> Brushing your teeth destroys bacteria, so it’s advisable to brush your teeth every day. </p>
<p> If your dog thinks that it is “too often,” you can start brushing once a week, and then gradually increase the frequency of brushing, until the dog is used to it. It is best to teach the dog to brush your teeth from puppyhood. </p>
<p> It is necessary to teach the puppy to give inspect the teeth and gums. Brush your teeth with the usual procedure for your dog. </p>
<p> Choose a suitable quiet time when the dog is not playing. Squeeze some toothpaste onto the toothbrush and spread it over the bristles so that the dog cannot lick it off the brush. Gently lift the dog's flames and start brushing the upper teeth and gums in a circular motion, about 10-15 seconds. Then lower teeth in the same way. </p>
<p> Do not forget to clean your back teeth, plaque and stone accumulate there most of all. </p>
<p> Turn the dog over and brush the teeth on the other side. Brushing your front teeth is not particularly necessary, but if you consider it necessary to clean them, you need to be very careful because they are very sensitive. </p>
<p> Do not worry about the fact that you can not brush your teeth from the inside, as the tongue helps to keep them clean. </p>
<p> Do not fuss while cleaning, proceed slowly and carefully. </p>
<p> Do not forget to praise the dog if it behaves well during cleaning, and also after cleaning encourage it with a treat, play or walk. Regular brushing can not only keep your teeth and gums healthy, but can actually help your dog live a long, happy and healthy life. </p>
