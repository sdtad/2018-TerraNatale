<p> After the terrorist attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center in 2001, the constant terrorist attacks in the North Caucasus, the need for well-trained search and rescue dogs to detect weapons, bombs, chemicals, explosives, drugs has greatly increased. Traditionally, for these purposes, German Shepherd Dogs and Belgian Shepherd Dogs were trained in the first place. Nowadays, retriever dogs are increasingly used to train search and rescue activities. What is unique about a retriever as a search and rescue dog? According to scientific research, most dogs can detect a single odor dissolved in air in very small quantities in a ratio of 1: 10,000,000. This ability to detect odors makes dogs more reliable than any mechanical device. In addition, dogs can hold, “remember” the smell. </p>

<p> These abilities are common to most dogs. The ability of dogs to follow the trail is also used by hunters. During the hunt, the hunter shows the dog only the area where she should find, say, a killed bird. </p>
<p> The dog will do everything that depends on it and will return, of course, with the prey in the teeth. When searching for prey, dogs should also ignore all foreign odors and not be distracted by them in order to carry out the task successfully. </p>
<p> These odors are sometimes so strong that the dogs are distracted unwittingly. </p>
<p> But not the retriever breed dogs. They are very focused and always carry out the task. </p>
<p> The selection of dogs for search and rescue is based on the following main criteria: </p>
<p> - goodwill and trusting attitude towards people. For example, Caucasian Shepherds, who treat strangers with distrust, are not suitable for such work; </p>
<p> - a good sense of smell and a desire to use it; </p>
<p> - physical strength and health. When conducting search and rescue operations, the animal has to move a lot for quite a long time, and when working on odor differentiation, the dog experiences serious psychophysical stresses; </p>
<p> is the size. The dog should not be very large, as a rule, not higher than 60 cm at the withers. When moving through the rubble of destroyed objects, a large, heavy dog more often and seriously injures its paws than a medium-sized dog. There are cases when rescuers have to carry dogs on their hands when conducting search and rescue operations. Big dogs are harder to transport, they need more feed, etc; </p>
<p> - the absence of a dog pronounced hunting instinct. Otherwise, it can be a serious obstacle during search and rescue operations: the dog will be distracted by birds, domestic and wild animals; </p>
<p> - easy learning. It is desirable that the working qualities were genetically fixed; </p>
<p> - no aggressiveness. The dog should not behave aggressively towards other animals; passion, persistence in work, strong character. The search and rescue labrador retrievers work with great instinct, thanks to special training and natural excitement. </p>
