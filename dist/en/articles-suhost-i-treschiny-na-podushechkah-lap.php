<p> Dogs may have over-dried paws for a variety of reasons, such as vitamin deficiencies, weather conditions, or age-related wear. You can take some measures to treat and prevent dry paws in a dog. Since the state of health and heredity of all dogs is different, it would also be helpful to consult with your veterinarian. Veterinarians can also help not only in identifying the causes of increased dryness of the paws in a dog, but also in the treatment of infected cracks on the paw pads. Household chemicals can cause increased dryness of the paws in dogs. Monitor the activity of the dog and isolate it from harmful effects that may aggravate its condition. Try changing the detergent for floors, furniture cleaners, laundry detergents with which you wash your dog's clothes, and also find a detergent with a low pH for washing paws after a walk, etc. Take measures to prevent excessive dryness of the paws of the dog due to weather conditions, lubricate them before walking with some kind of protective cream. </p>
<p> Wash your dog's paws because of the reagents on the roads and grease them with cream after washing. Change routes, do not drive the dog on roads that are treated with salt or chemicals. With the help of dog home booties you can protect your dog's paws from painful dryness. Put cotton pads in them with a moisturizing cream or with some natural oil (shea butter is especially recommended). Eliminate all possible sources of allergens and skin irritants. Use dog boots to protect paws in inclement weather. Do not drive a dog with cracked paws on a rough or very uneven surface. </p>

<p> Increase the dose of vitamin E in the dog's feed. It is even better to buy it in liquid form and very carefully lubricate the paw pads of the dog. Also, the cause of dry paws can be a deficiency in the body of a dog of zinc. </p>
<p> Cracks on the pads - may be specific dermatitis associated with a lack of biotin. Biotin (or vitamin H) is normally produced by intestinal microflora. Biotin deficiency can occur either due to some metabolic disorders, or due to problems with the microflora. Biotin is very rich in animal liver, so adding 100 grams of raw frozen beef liver to a dog's diet should help your dog. In parallel, treat it with microflora preparations (bifidumbacterin, lactobifadol, bactisubtil, etc.) </p>
<p> Always make sure that the dog always has water in the bowl. </p>
<p> For dogs with increased dryness, various special moisturizers are available. </p>
<p> To protect the paws of a dog, you can use wax (manufactured by 8 in 1). </p>
<center><img src="<?php print $siteurleng;?>img/articles/articles9-3.jpg"></center>
<p> Protective mixture prescription Filimonova S.: 40% inner fat; 40% pure lanolin; 20% beeswax. We melt all these components and mix them together, then pour them into a jar and process the paws before walking. It is good to spray the Show Foot-professional anti-slip spray from Biogrumm from above, it is used to better fix the dog at an exhibition running on a slippery and parquet floor - this will create a protective film. Before going out on the street, the dog can also handle its paws with film-forming aerosols - cubatol or chronicin. It is good to lubricate the protective silicone cream (it is sold in a perfume shop - usually to protect your hands). But! Before smearing paws, do not forget to remove excess hair between the fingers of a dog. Remove the hair very carefully, so as not to injure the paw and not cut the membranes, use small (but not tiny), sharp scissors with stupid ends. </p>
<p> When contaminated, microbes remain on the coat, possibly development of mycoses. If there is a lot of wool, snow will stick to it, the dog will constantly fall down and clean its paws. </p>
<p> If there is no wool, then the snow in the paw does not linger and does not stick. </p>
<p> Now you can find various shoes and boots on sale. Without them you will not do if you have a leg injury (the paw does not get wet and does not get dirty). In stores you can find sets for sled dogs. These are 4 boots (for each leg), they are high and fasten in 3 places, dragging on a sticky tape around the leg. Boots are made of very durable material. </p>

<p> After the walk, you washed the feet, wiped them and smeared them well with cream or balm. You can use the Dawn ointment (do not be afraid, milking cream with floralisin, for animals, you can add vitamin A oil solution to the cream). </p>
<p> So that the dog does not lick the cream they put baby socks on their paws. These measures will protect the paws of your retrievers from cracks and wounds. On the night of the paws, it is good to lubricate the homeopathic ointment "Graphite" (this tool is used for cracks in the paws). </p>
<p> But we want to immediately warn. The ointment is black and very oily (the base is petroleum jelly). Using it, it is good to wear poliet top. bags. It is necessary to do for better penetration of the ointment into the cracks of the paws (“compress” effect), the bags should be bandaged, fixed on top. The cream-gel from corns (Ambulance) also “works” well. Wax, olive oil , salicylic acid, extracts: celandine, aloe, nettle, garlic, potato, glycerin, vitamin A, collagen). </p>
<p> You can lubricate the paws with the Balsam "Rescuer" or "The Guardian", with the ointment "Actovegin" or "Solcoseryl". </p>
