	<p>Now treadmills for dogs have become very widely advertised and used in the halls. In principle, if the owner is not possible due to time or health, “rytsit” with a dog on a leash around the microdistrict, it should be great. <br> But the question is - how correctly are they used? <br> And is it possible to use them for the good and without damage to health?</p>

<p> In order not to seem like an ardent opponent of tracks, I initially want to say: I have a track at home, standing in the middle of my living room, with dog beds and cabins, and my dogs are training on it, but thoughtfully and very carefully. </p>
<p> The treadmill is a sword with two blades. And the edge of "danger" is much sharper than the edge of good. </p>

<p style="color:#993300; text-transform:uppercase;">Track benefits: </p>
<p> - not everyone and not always we have the time or opportunity to walk a dog enough. But the dog needs a sufficient amount of movement and physical activity. Sufficient - this does not mean that you should make an athlete's dog. </p>
<p> Executing loads is even more harmful than undershoot. But the dog needs movement and some physical activity in order to be balanced in character and happy. A dog with a complete lack or absence of walks becomes nervous and not happy. </p>
<p> As an example: I have 9 dogs, and although I live in a house with a garden, dogs do not naturally run and walk in the garden. They either do their business there or lie around looking around. Therefore, walks are absolutely necessary. But the laws and life in Belgium are such that we can walk with dogs only on leashes, in Belgium there are practically no publicly accessible forests or fields where you can let the dogs run. They run in the fields or in the forest or on the sea, they are extremely rare. Dogs go hunting separately, but this is also not all year round. This gives us a situation that my dogs walk only on leashes. Walking 7 dogs on leashes is enough - not always possible. If my flock in 9 dogs did not get enough load, then they just start to be unhappy, they have too much unused energy, they start to be nervous or overly active at home, which does not make life easier for them or for us - their leaders. In this regard, I use the track as a small additional load 2-3 times a week. </p>
<p> If I had the opportunity to walk with dogs without leashes every day in the woods or in the park, half an hour - an hour a day plus the necessary and proper loads on the leash - I would not use the track. </p>
<p style="color:#993300; text-transform:uppercase;">What harm can a track do if used improperly and unprofessionally? </p>
<p> If we are talking about physical health: </p>
<p> - heart problems </p>
<p> - injuries of the musculoskeletal system </p>
<p> - spinal problems </p>
<p> Problems with the spine is for example spondylosis, at the moment an incredibly common problem, osteochondrosis, and a lot of still different others. Why is it impossible to use a track for a spinal problem? Because due to the fact that the track lane has a measured width of the canvas, the dog, while moving on the track, not only loads the joints significantly more than with a lynx even on asphalt (due to the fact that the track moves underfoot, but asphalt does not ), but also loading the spine of the dog, which leads to stiff back and even more spondylosis. (When a dog is forced to run along a stretched canvas track, it strains muscles too much and goes out of balance of the body, which leads to spinal curvature, unnecessary loads in the spine, disc displacement, etc.) Why not with heart problems? </p>
<p> Because the track is a much greater load on the body - than trotting on the ground in the first place for many reasons: </p>
<p> 1 - the dog cannot choose a comfortable and comfortable pace for it. We choose the pace. </p>
<p> 2 - the pace of the lynx is the same all the time, which does not happen when trotting on the ground. The dog on the ground changes the pace of movement. Let it be invisible to our eyes or little noticeable, but the pace when trotting on the ground is not ideally the same as on the track. </p>
<p> 3 - the dog cannot stop on the track or in some very clear way for us to show that it needs to stop. </p>
<p> And many of us, unfortunately, even if they see and understand that the dog wants to stop, they will not stop the path - having decided that the dog is just lazy. Secondly, the path cannot be used for cores because the dog does not receive enough oxygen when working on the path indoors - unless of course the path is not installed in the garden in the open air or near the window by the door (for example, my path stands next to the window from the ceiling to the floor with a sliding door. </p>
<p> And whatever the season - this door is fully open during the classes. Door size is 2.50 meters high and 5m wide. </p>
<p> The path can ruin the movement again in connection with the above about the width of the canvas, and the fact that the "floor" is moving under your feet. If the dog is not properly trained to work on the track, if the owner forced it to ransom too early, without having taught her to walk along the path in a completely comfortable and balanced way, the movements of the dog will become squeezed, without lifting, heavy and vertical regarding the floor, instead of the horizontal ones needed for most breeds. </p>
<p> We should remember that a dog is not a human being. Dogs are much wiser than we are, dogs are much better “people” than we, but dogs are different. If for us the path is just a path, then for a dog that moving the floor under your feet is an anti-natural situation. And the dog needs a long time to come to terms with this fact and start moving freely and relaxed. </p>
<p style = "color: #993300; text-transform: uppercase;"> For most breeds, the path is contraindicated for up to 18 months. Why? </p>
<p> Because most breeds grow to 18 months, not only that, there are quite a few breeds that grow to 3 years. And to put a dog that is in the period of growth is not only unsafe but simply destructive in my opinion. Why? Because in the period of growth, when everything is still changing and growing, any microtrauma, any too large or irregular load can turn into an incorrigible drama for a lifetime. </p>
<p> If we are talking about the beauty and correctness of the dog's movements: </p>
<p> - the track can completely spoil the movement of the dog. This problem can not be fixed later. </p>
<p> - The track should not be used for “motion setting.” </p>
<p> Having said all this, we see that the track can not be used as a complete alternative to movement - walks, can not be used for setting movements. Therefore, if you do not have a really deep knowledge of using the track, then you should not use it. If you want to take your dog to the center, where there is a walkway, before you allow you to practice with your dog, ask the trainer if he has an appropriate diploma, indicating that he has completed training courses for such a trainer. If such a diploma is not available, then I would not give my dog in the hands of this coach. Never in my life. </p>
<p style = "color: #993300; text-transform: uppercase;"> If you want to train the dog on the track yourself, here are a few things you should always remember. </p>
<p> The track should be long enough. For example, for the Retriever - the path must be at least 2.20 in length. </p>
<p> Anything shorter is very dangerous. How to teach the dog to the track and safe schemes of work on the tracks. </p>
<p> The first thing to remember is that only an absolutely healthy dog can work on the track. </p>
<p> If a dog has or has heart problems, any problems with the musculoskeletal system or the spine, the dog cannot be put on the track. Also, if your dog has a bad trot in the ring, do not think that the trot will correct or improve the trot. Lynx is done on the street, on the ground, and not on the track. </p>
<p> The first month of work on the track - we only accustom the dog to the track, and this means that we do every day, but very little. The dog must love the track, it must want to run and practice on it. </p>
<p> And it’s our job to make it a pleasure for them in the first place. Otherwise, the benefit that the track has is completely gone and only the dangers of its use remain. </p>
<p> Until the dog itself, with pleasure and desire and sheer joy, runs into the track, looking forward to the start of classes - we cannot take the dog to a trot or a quick step. </p>
<p> We must continue to do everything possible at a slow pace, so that the dog "entered the taste." You can not force a dog on the track, you can not force it on. </p>
<p> All methods when a dog is put on a harness and tied to the walls of the track, or when several people are pulled on a leash or pushed under the ass is not permissible when using the track. It is just dangerous for the health of the dog. We initially need to spend a lot of energy, patience and ingenuity to make any dog love the track. If the dog does not like the track - we will only cause harm. Often unrecoverable. The first 3 days, or as long as the dog will need it - but not earlier than after 3 days, work with the dog on the track for a very tasty treat at an initial speed of no more than 1 km per hour. When the dog is completely comfortable on the track at this speed, the speed can be increased to a very slow pace. </p>

<p style="color:#993300; text-transform:uppercase;">Use the down-up funky track and lynx. </p>
<p> Most tracks have an up and down function. Only after 2-3 weeks of using the track at a very slow step - we can start using the function up and down. The up-down function is used only by increasing the slope of the track 1% per day or until the dog is walking at a slow pace, completely comfortable. Starting classes using the "up - down" functions, we start with 1-2 minutes and in 2-3 weeks we bring to no more than 10 minutes. That is, it turns out that by folding the first 2-3 weeks for training to the track and 2-3 weeks of training for the up-down function, the dog can work on the track at a slow pace for a maximum of 10 minutes a day. Never use the function up or down for longer than 3-5 minutes for 1 lesson. When the dog completely mastered the function up and down at a slow pace - we can increase the speed at a quick pace. By the end of 4 weeks of using the workouts in quick steps, the maximum that a dog can spend on the track is 30 minutes a day. Of these, the dog can go a maximum of 3-5 minutes up or down. Only after 4 weeks of fast stride, can we translate a dog to a lynx. After 6 weeks from the start of the trot, the maximum possible trot on the track is 20 minutes. </p>
<p> Never make a dog roam for more than 20 minutes. In this case, the maximum use of the function up or down 3-5 minutes. And the maximum spent by the dog on the track in any case remains 30 minutes. </p>
<center><iframe width="280" height="170" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Zri98Er_OU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
<p style="color:#993300; text-transform:uppercase;">It should also be remembered that the muscles should be warmed up before workouts, and cooled after workouts. </p>
<p> This means that when a dog is already walking fast or trotting, the first 2 minutes of training should always be a warm-up - when the dog is walking slowly and the last 2 minutes of training is also always a slow step. </p>
<p> Never force a dog and monitor its condition. If the dog moves near the back end of the track, it means that it is tired, or the pace of the track is too fast. Immediately reduce the pace of the track. If the dog is running behind the canopy, with his head down, immediately reduce the pace to a slow pace, let the dog go 100 meters with a slow step and finish the exercises. On the day when the dog was working on the track, the walk should be halved. Also, I think everyone understands that you should not use the track for puppies up to 18 months and with great care to use the track for older dogs. With any other use of the track - the track will cause a lot of damage. Therefore, I advise you to use the track with extreme caution or not at all if you are not confident in your knowledge or the professionalism of the coach. By the use of tracks in the halls of Russia, I am extremely negative (forgive me for those users who may have halls.) In my opinion, in Russia, halls with paths are just a good and profitable business, having very little in common with the knowledge of the dog's anatomy, its physical needs and track usage. The owners of the halls buy paths and without going through any training - they put dogs on the paths. Often, too often, unfortunately it ends with dramas. If you want to use the benefits of using safety tracks for health, it is better to either buy your own track (now the official distributor of English tracks Fit For Life has appeared, which I use and I think is the best at the moment), or try to learn how to use the track myself and work with the dog on the track in the hall itself, too, of course if in the hall there is the correct track format for your breed. </p> <br>
