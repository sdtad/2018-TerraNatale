	<p>Chewing is quite normal for a puppy, especially when his teeth are cut (about 4 months). However, at the age of 3 to 6 months, you can begin to “explain” to your puppy that you cannot nibble at home. A puppy must understand that he can be chewed, and that - no. Otherwise, he will assume that he can gnaw absolutely everything.</p>

<p> Some puppy owners do not attach special importance to this problem, because they think how cute it is when the puppy nibbles a thing that is twice its size, or simply because they don’t know how to wean it off. Some owners, as a result, bring the situation to the point that they either return the puppy to its breeder, or donate it to a dog shelter, or even worse, put it to sleep! Chewing helps to reduce pain in a puppy during the change of milk teeth to permanent ones. </p>

<p> That's why the puppy is trying to try different things: shoes, socks, books, furniture - in general, everything that may be available to him. A rag or towel, frozen in a refrigerator, can be a good remedy to ease the puppy's pain. Give him such a toy - let him chew and freeze the pain at the same time. Unfortunately, the puppy instinctively does not know what cannot be chewed by him, therefore your task is to teach him what is possible and what is not. In addition to changing teeth, there are several reasons for chewing, for example, during games, from boredom, and sometimes from hunger. Sometimes puppies gnaw things, trying to win or demonstrate their dominant position over you or other family members. Excess energy in a puppy can also encourage him to chew. </p>
<p> <span style = "font-weight: bold;"> Tip 1. When playing with a puppy, never let him bite people. </span> It is very important to make the puppy understand that he should never bite a person or tear him clothes Stop the game immediately as soon as it bites you. Scream and show him with all your appearance how much you hurt. </p>
<p> <span style = "font-weight: bold;"> Tip 2. Remove things that a puppy can chew. </span> Even before you bring a puppy to your home, you must think and remove at least for six months things that a puppy can chew. Put them somewhere higher so that he cannot get them or put them in plastic boxes. Explain to the children that they must clean their toys after they have played, and have them keep them away from a curious puppy. Consider that the trash can is beyond the reach of your puppy. Do not forget about expensive stuff, such as a TV remote, glasses, phones, wallets, etc. </p>
<p> <span style = "font-weight: bold;"> Tip 3. While the puppy is small, try to keep it as little as possible unattended. </span> If you leave the room, put the puppy in a puppy playpen or close the door to the room. </p>
<p> <span style = "font-weight: bold;"> Tip 4. Limit his freedom to work in the house. </span> If you need to leave home, or you cannot look after your puppy at home for a while, it is best to put him in a collapsible playpen for puppies until you can return home or finish your urgent business. Do not forget to put in the playpen his favorite (safe) chewable toys for dogs. </p>

<p> <span style = "font-weight: bold;"> Tip 5. Take a puppy more. </span> If a puppy gnaws from boredom, it would be very useful to load him with activities and walks. A puppy at the age of about 12 weeks can already make 2-3 walks, 15-20 minutes a day. In addition, it is necessary to begin his training approximately 2 times a day for 10 minutes. As he grows older, the duration of his walks and training should increase. An adult retriever should walk 2 times a day, at least 1 hour each time. The duration of training a puppy needs to be increased very carefully and gradually, otherwise it will quickly tire and lose interest in learning. With the help of mental and physical stress, the puppy will spend excess energy, so he will sleep more often, rather than gnawing furniture or things from boredom. </p>
<p> <span style = "font-weight: bold;"> Tip 6. Do not let your puppy chew your shoes. </span> If the puppy squeezes your new shoes, you will be guilty because you did not remove them on time. All shoes must be cleaned in a closet or in plastic boxes, because they strongly smell you and a puppy that yearns alone doesn’t sweeter than gnaw them out of great love for you. </p>
<p> <span style = "font-weight: bold;"> Tip 7. Buy a puppy a lot of chewing toys. </span> Buy a puppy a lot of special safe chewing toys for puppies, for example, dried skin bones, rubber toys, toys with ropes, etc. They are all good for speeding up a puppy's teeth shift. If the puppy reluctantly gnaws the chewing toys or bones you have bought, then try to smear them a little with malt extract, a piece of meat or a liver for a tasty smell. Try to change the types of toys or bones so that they do not become boring and bored with the puppy. </p>

<p> <span style = "font-weight: bold;"> Tip 8. Play more with the puppy outside. </span> Puppies love to play various interactive games. It is necessary for their mental development. All retrievers love to play with chopsticks. Throw him a wand, let him learn to bring her back to you and give to his hands. Buy a ball or a flying saucer for playing games with a puppy. In addition, outdoor games contribute to the development of a puppy. </p>

<p> <span style = "font-weight: bold;"> Tip 9. "No!" and "Well done!". </span> If you see that the puppy is chewing your thing, then in a strong and loud voice say to him: "You can not!". Do not shout hard, otherwise you can shock the puppy. Take the thing and give him the one that he can chew, for example, one of his toys, and when he takes it, praise him: "Well done!". Say "no!" it is possible only when the puppy is directly busy chewing things, otherwise he will not understand what your “No” refers to. Therefore, punishing a puppy after he left to chew a thing is pointless. If the puppy gnaws the furniture (do not carry all the furniture out of the house), then you need to warn him: “No!”, Then take him away from the furniture, give him his chewing toy and when he takes it, praise him. If you are patient and persistent, then eventually the puppy will figure out what he can chew on and what not. </p>
<p> <span style = "font-weight: bold;"> Tip 10. Special exercises. </span> Put your thing on the floor, and next to it is a chewing toy or bone. Pretend that you do not look, for example, take a book and read. If the puppy comes up and takes your item, then take it away from him and say "No!" If the puppy chooses his toy or bone, then praise him. Repeat this exercise with your various things. </p><br>
<p> If the puppy shows a persistent interest in your furniture, then you can buy a special spray at the pet store to stop chewing in dogs. The spray has an unpleasant smell and taste for dogs, and it is very convenient to spray it on the legs of furniture. However, the spray does not affect all puppies and dogs, but it’s still worth a try. </p>
